A thin rod has mass $4$ kg and length $1.5$ m. It rotates about one end. If the net moment about the end is $6$ N$\cdot$m, find its angular acceleration.

:::solution
First find the mass moment of inertia about the end using the parallel-axis theorem:

$$
I_G = \frac{1}{12}mL^2 = \frac{1}{12}(4)(1.5^2) = 0.75 \, \text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2
$$

The center of mass is $d = 0.75$ m from the end, so

$$
I_O = I_G + md^2 = 0.75 + 4(0.75^2) = 3.0 \, \text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2

A rigid bar has point $A$ moving to the right at $2 \, \text{m/s}$ with acceleration $1 \, \text{m/s}^2$ to the right. The bar rotates counterclockwise with $\omega = 4 \, \text{rad/s}$ and $\alpha = 2 \, \text{rad/s}^2$. Point $B$ is $0.5$ m above $A$. Find $\mathbf{v}_B$ and $\mathbf{a}_B$.

:::solution
Use the rigid-body relations:

$$
\mathbf{v}_B = \mathbf{v}_A + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}_{B/A}
$$

$$
\mathbf{a}_B = \mathbf{a}_A + \boldsymbol{\alpha} \times \mathbf{r}_{B/A} + \boldsymbol{\omega} \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}_{B/A})
$$

Take

$$
\mathbf{v}_A = 2\,\mathbf{i}, \quad \mathbf{a}_A = 1\,\mathbf{i}, \quad \boldsymbol{\omega} = 4\,\mathbf{k}, \quad \boldsymbol{\alpha} = 2\,\mathbf{k}, \quad \mathbf{r}_{B/A} = 0.5\,\mathbf{j}
$$

Then

$$
\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}_{B/A}
= 4\mathbf{k} \times 0.5\mathbf{j}
= -2\,\mathbf{i}
$$

so

$$
\mathbf{v}_B = 2\,\mathbf{i} - 2\,\mathbf{i} = \mathbf{0}
$$

For acceleration,

$$
\boldsymbol{\alpha} \times \mathbf{r}_{B/A}
= 2\mathbf{k} \times 0.5\mathbf{j}
= -1\,\mathbf{i}
$$

and

$$
\boldsymbol{\omega} \times (\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}_{B/A})
= 4\mathbf{k} \times (-2\,\mathbf{i})
= -8\,\mathbf{j}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\mathbf{a}_B = 1\,\mathbf{i} - 1\,\mathbf{i} - 8\,\mathbf{j} = -8\,\mathbf{j}
$$

So point $B$ is instantaneously at rest, and its acceleration is $8 \, \text{m/s}^2$ downward.

A $2$ kg cart slows from $6 \, \text{m/s}$ to $2 \, \text{m/s}$ in $0.1$ s during a collision. What method should you use to find the average impact force, and what is that force?

:::solution
Use **impulse-momentum** because the force acts over a short time and the velocity change is given.

Take the positive direction as the initial direction of motion:

$$
\Delta p = m(v_2 - v_1) = 2(2 - 6) = -8 \, \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}
$$

Average force:

$$
F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t} = \frac{-8}{0.1} = -80 \, \text{N}
$$

So the average impact force is $80$ N opposite the cart's motion.

Find $\mathbf{v}$ and $\mathbf{a}$ at $t=2$, and determine whether the particle is speeding up or slowing down at that instant.

:::solution
Write the velocity vector:

$$
\mathbf{v}(t) = \dot{x}\,\mathbf{i} + \dot{y}\,\mathbf{j}
$$

so

$$
\mathbf{v}(t) = 2t\,\mathbf{i} + (4t - 4)\,\mathbf{j}

At $t=2$:

$$
\mathbf{v}(2) = 4\,\mathbf{i} + 4\,\mathbf{j}

Differentiate again:

$$
\mathbf{a}(t) = 2\,\mathbf{i} + 4\,\mathbf{j}

The speed is

$$
|\mathbf{v}(2)| = \sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = 4\sqrt{2}

Since the acceleration points generally in the same direction as the velocity, the particle is speeding up at $t=2$.

A collar slides outward in a radial slot on a disk rotating counterclockwise with constant angular velocity $\omega = 4 \, \text{rad/s}$. At the instant shown, the collar is $0.5$ m from the center and has outward relative speed $\dot{r} = 2 \, \text{m/s}$. The disk has no angular acceleration and the radial speed is constant, so $\ddot{r} = 0$. Find the Coriolis acceleration magnitude and the total acceleration vector.

For a rotating frame, the Coriolis term is

2\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{v}_{rel}

Its magnitude is

$$
2\omega v_{rel} = 2(4)(2) = 16 \, \text{m/s}^2

Since $\dot{r}$ is constant, $\mathbf{a}_{rel} = 0$ and $\boldsymbol{\alpha} = 0$.

The centripetal term is
