If

$$
q(t) = 4t^2 + 3t
$$

in coulombs, what is the current at $t = 2$ s?

:::solution
Current is the derivative of charge:

$$
i(t) = \frac{dq}{dt} = 8t + 3
$$

Evaluate at $t = 2$:

$$
i(2) = 8(2) + 3 = 19
$$

So the current is $19$ A.

Substitute the values:

$$
V_{out} = 12\frac{4}{2 + 4} = 12\cdot\frac{2}{3} = 8

A total current of $6$ A enters two parallel resistors, $3~\Omega$ and $6~\Omega$.

What current flows through the $3~\Omega$ branch?

:::solution
For two parallel resistors, the current in one branch is

Here,

$$
I_{3\Omega} = 6\frac{6}{3 + 6} = 6\cdot\frac{2}{3} = 4

Substitute the values:

A supernode contains two unknown node voltages $V_a$ and $V_b$.

Node $a$ connects to ground through $6~\Omega$, node $b$ connects to ground through $3~\Omega$, and a $9$ V source connects $b$ to $a$ with the positive terminal at $a$.

If a total of $3$ A enters the supernode from an external source, what is $V_a$?

:::solution
Use KCL on the supernode:

$$
\frac{V_a}{6} + \frac{V_b}{3} = 3
$$

The voltage source gives the constraint:

$$
V_a - V_b = 9
$$

Substitute $V_a = V_b + 9$ into KCL:

$$
\frac{V_b + 9}{6} + \frac{V_b}{3} = 3
$$

Multiply by $6$:

$$
V_b + 9 + 2V_b = 18
$$

$$
3V_b = 9
$$

$$
V_b = 3
$$

Then

$$
V_a = 3 + 9 = 12

Two clockwise mesh currents $i_1$ and $i_2$ share a $1~\Omega$ resistor.

The left mesh has a $1~\Omega$ resistor and a $12$ V source. The right mesh has a $1~\Omega$ resistor and no source.

What are $i_1$ and $i_2$?

:::solution
Write KVL for each mesh.

Left mesh:

$$
1i_1 + 1(i_1 - i_2) = 12
$$

which simplifies to

$$
2i_1 - i_2 = 12
$$

Right mesh:

$$
1i_2 + 1(i_2 - i_1) = 0
$$

which simplifies to

$$
-i_1 + 2i_2 = 0
$$

From the second equation,

$$
i_1 = 2i_2
$$

Substitute into the first:

$$
2(2i_2) - i_2 = 12
$$

$$
3i_2 = 12
$$

$$
i_2 = 4
$$

Then

$$
i_1 = 8

So $i_1 = 8$ A and $i_2 = 4$ A.

Two clockwise mesh currents $i_1$ and $i_2$ share a branch with a $1$ A current source.

The current source forces

$$
i_2 - i_1 = 1

The outer loop contains two $3~\Omega$ resistors and a $15$ V source.

What are $i_1$ and $i_2$?

:::solution
Write KVL around the outer perimeter of the supermesh:

$$
3i_1 + 3i_2 = 15
$$

The current-source constraint is

$$
i_2 - i_1 = 1
$$

From the constraint,

$$
i_2 = i_1 + 1
$$

Substitute into the KVL equation:

$$
3i_1 + 3(i_1 + 1) = 15
$$

$$
6i_1 + 3 = 15
$$

$$
6i_1 = 12

$$
i_1 = 2

Then

$$
i_2 = 3

So $i_1 = 2$ A and $i_2 = 3$ A.

A node is connected to ground through a $6~\Omega$ resistor.

The same node is also connected through another $6~\Omega$ resistor to a $12$ V source, and a $3$ A current source injects current into the node from ground.

What is the node voltage?

:::solution
Use superposition.

First, keep the $12$ V source and open the current source. The node is then a divider between $12$ V and ground through two equal $6~\Omega$ resistors, so the node voltage is:

$$
V_1 = 12\frac{6}{6+6} = 6
$$

Next, keep the $3$ A source and short the $12$ V source. Then the node sees two $6~\Omega$ resistors in parallel:

$$
R_{eq} = \frac{6\cdot 6}{6+6} = 3
$$

So the voltage contribution is

$$
V_2 = IR = 3 \cdot 3 = 9
$$

Add the contributions:

$$
V = V_1 + V_2 = 6 + 9 = 15
$$

So the node voltage is $15$ V.

A $12$ V source feeds a $2~\Omega$ resistor in series with a node.

Find the Thevenin equivalent voltage and resistance seen at the node with respect to ground.

:::solution
The open-circuit voltage is the divider voltage across the $4~\Omega$ resistor:

$$
V_{th} = 12\frac{4}{2+4} = 8
$$

To find $R_{th}$, deactivate the independent source. The $12$ V source becomes a short circuit, so the $2~\Omega$ and $4~\Omega$ resistors are both from the node to ground:

$$
R_{th} = \frac{2\cdot 4}{2+4} = \frac{8}{6} = \frac{4}{3}

For a charging capacitor,

v_C(t) = v_C(\infty) + \bigl(v_C(0^+) - v_C(\infty)\bigr)e^{-t/\tau}

The capacitor voltage cannot change instantly, so

The time constant is

v_C(t) = 18 + (6 - 18)e^{-t/0.2}
