A fluid has density $1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$ and dynamic viscosity $1.0\times 10^{-3}\ \text{Pa}\cdot\text{s}$.

Find:

- its specific weight $\gamma$
- its specific volume $v$
- its kinematic viscosity $\nu$

Also state whether this fluid is usually modeled as incompressible and Newtonian in ordinary pipe flow.

:::solution
Use the definitions:

$$
\gamma = \rho g = 1000(9.81) = 9810\ \text{N/m}^3
$$

$$
v = \frac{1}{\rho} = \frac{1}{1000} = 1.0\times 10^{-3}\ \text{m}^3/\text{kg}
$$

$$
\nu = \frac{\mu}{\rho} = \frac{1.0\times 10^{-3}}{1000} = 1.0\times 10^{-6}\ \text{m}^2/\text{s}
$$

This fluid is commonly modeled as incompressible and Newtonian in ordinary pipe flow.

Compute the Reynolds number:

$$

Since $\mathrm{Re} \ll 2300$, the flow is laminar.

What is the gauge pressure $6$ m below the free surface in fresh water?

Use $\rho = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$ and $g = 9.81\ \text{m/s}^2$.

:::solution
For a fluid at rest, pressure increases with depth:

$$
p = \rho g h

$$
p = 1000(9.81)(6) = 58860\ \text{Pa}

p \approx 58.9\ \text{kPa}

---

A gauge reads $150\ \text{kPa}$ in water.

What pressure head does this correspond to?

:::solution
Pressure head is

$$
\frac{p}{\gamma}
$$

For water, $\gamma = \rho g = 1000(9.81) = 9810\ \text{N/m}^3$.

Thus

$$
\frac{p}{\gamma} = \frac{150000}{9810} \approx 15.3\ \text{m}

So the pressure head is about $15.3$ m of water.

Water flows through a $60$ mm pipe at $3.0\ \text{m/s}$ and then enters a $30$ mm nozzle.

Find the volumetric flow rate and the nozzle exit speed.

$$

Now use continuity at the nozzle:

$$
A_2 = \frac{\pi}{4}(0.030)^2

$$

skills: [Bernoulli Equation, Pressure]
---

In a horizontal water line, the speed increases from $2\ \text{m/s}$ to $6\ \text{m/s}$.

What is the pressure drop between the two points?

:::solution
For steady, incompressible, inviscid flow at the same elevation,

$$
\frac{p_1}{\gamma} + \frac{V_1^2}{2g}
=
\frac{p_2}{\gamma} + \frac{V_2^2}{2g}
$$

So

$$
p_1 - p_2 = \frac{1}{2}\rho\left(V_2^2 - V_1^2\right)
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
p_1 - p_2 = \frac{1}{2}(1000)(6^2 - 2^2)
$$

$$
p_1 - p_2 = 500(36 - 4) = 16000\ \text{Pa}

So the pressure drops by $16\ \text{kPa}$.

$$
p_0 = 101000 + 540 = 101540\ \text{Pa}

A tank gas is connected to a U-tube manometer. On the tank side, $5$ cm of water sits above mercury. The mercury level on the open side is $15$ cm higher than the mercury-water interface on the tank side. The open side is at atmospheric pressure.

Find the gas gauge pressure in the tank.

:::solution
Start at the open surface, where the pressure is atmospheric.

Move down $0.15$ m in mercury:

$$
p = p_{\text{atm}} + \rho_{\text{Hg}} g(0.15)
$$

Then move up $0.05$ m in water to the tank gas:

$$
p_{\text{tank}} = p_{\text{atm}} + \rho_{\text{Hg}} g(0.15) - \rho_w g(0.05)
$$

So the gauge pressure is

$$
p_g = \rho_{\text{Hg}} g(0.15) - \rho_w g(0.05)
$$

Using $\rho_{\text{Hg}} = 13600\ \text{kg/m}^3$ and $\rho_w = 1000\ \text{kg/m}^3$:

$$
p_g = 13600(9.81)(0.15) - 1000(9.81)(0.05)

$$
p_g \approx 19.5\ \text{kPa}

A vertical rectangular gate is $2$ m high and $1$ m wide. Its top edge is $3$ m below the free surface in water.

Find the resultant hydrostatic force and the depth of the center of pressure below the free surface.

:::solution
The centroid of the gate is at a depth

$$
h_c = 3 + 1 = 4\ \text{m}
$$

The area is

$$
A = 2(1) = 2\ \text{m}^2
$$

So the resultant force is

$$
F_R = \rho g h_c A = 1000(9.81)(4)(2) = 78480\ \text{N}
$$

$$
F_R \approx 78.5\ \text{kN}
$$

For the center of pressure,

$$
h_p = h_c + \frac{I_G}{h_cA}

For a rectangle,

$$
I_G = \frac{bh^3}{12} = \frac{1(2^3)}{12} = \frac{8}{12} = 0.667\ \text{m}^4

A $0.10$ m diameter pipe carries water at $4.0\ \text{m/s}$ through a 90-degree elbow.

Neglect pressure forces and weight.

What is the magnitude of the force the fluid exerts on the elbow?

:::solution
First find the mass flow rate:

$$
A = \frac{\pi}{4}(0.10)^2
$$

$$
\dot{m} = \rho AV = 1000\left(\frac{\pi}{4}(0.10)^2\right)(4.0) \approx 31.4\ \text{kg/s}
$$

The inlet velocity is along one axis and the outlet velocity is along a perpendicular axis, both with speed $4.0\ \text{m/s}$.

So the momentum change has components of magnitude

$$
\dot{m}V = 31.4(4.0) = 125.6\ \text{N}
$$

The resultant force magnitude is

$$
F = \sqrt{125.6^2 + 125.6^2} = 125.6\sqrt{2} \approx 177.6\ \text{N}
$$

So the fluid exerts a force of about $178\ \text{N}$ on the elbow.

A spillway model is built at $1:36$ scale using the same fluid as the prototype.

If the prototype surface speed is $6\ \text{m/s}$, what model speed gives Froude similarity?

:::solution
For free-surface flow, match the Froude number:

$$
\mathrm{Fr} = \frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}}
$$

So

$$
\frac{V_m}{V_p} = \sqrt{\frac{L_m}{L_p}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{36}} = \frac{1}{6}
$$

Therefore

$$
V_m = 6\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) = 1\ \text{m/s}
$$

Exact Reynolds similarity is not possible at this scale with the same fluid, so Froude similarity is the governing choice.

Water flows through a $40$ m long pipe of diameter $50$ mm at $2.0\ \text{m/s}$.

The Darcy friction factor is $0.03$, and the total minor-loss coefficient is $2.0$.

Find the total head loss and the equivalent pressure drop.

:::solution
First compute the velocity head:

$$
\frac{V^2}{2g} = \frac{2.0^2}{2(9.81)} \approx 0.204\ \text{m}
$$

Major loss:

$$
h_f = f\frac{L}{D}\frac{V^2}{2g}
= 0.03\left(\frac{40}{0.05}\right)(0.204)
$$

$$
h_f \approx 4.89\ \text{m}
$$

Minor loss:

$$
h_m = K\frac{V^2}{2g} = 2.0(0.204) \approx 0.41\ \text{m}
$$

Total head loss:

$$
h_L = h_f + h_m \approx 5.30\ \text{m}
$$

Equivalent pressure drop:

$$
\Delta p = \rho g h_L = 1000(9.81)(5.30) \approx 5.20\times 10^4\ \text{Pa}

So the pressure drop is about $52\ \text{kPa}$.

Water flows at $0.015\ \text{m}^3/\text{s}$ through an $80$ m long, $0.10$ m diameter pipe that rises $5$ m and discharges to atmosphere at the same diameter.

Take the Darcy friction factor as $0.02$ and neglect minor losses.

What inlet gauge pressure is needed?

:::solution
First find the pipe speed:

$$
A = \frac{\pi}{4}(0.10)^2
$$

$$
V = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{0.015}{\pi(0.10)^2/4} \approx 1.91\ \text{m/s}
$$

The velocity head is

$$
\frac{V^2}{2g} \approx \frac{1.91^2}{2(9.81)} \approx 0.186\ \text{m}
$$

The friction loss is

$$
h_f = f\frac{L}{D}\frac{V^2}{2g}
= 0.02\left(\frac{80}{0.10}\right)(0.186)
$$

$$
h_f \approx 2.97\ \text{m}
$$

Because the pipe diameter is the same at inlet and outlet, the velocity heads cancel. The inlet gauge pressure must supply the elevation rise plus the friction loss:

$$
\frac{p_{in}}{\gamma} = 5 + 2.97 = 7.97\ \text{m}
$$

Thus

$$
p_{in} = 1000(9.81)(7.97) \approx 7.82\times 10^4\ \text{Pa}
$$

So the required inlet gauge pressure is about $78.2\ \text{kPa}$.

\approx 39.3\ \text{kg/s}

The change in velocity in the jet direction is from $20\ \text{m/s}$ to $0$, so the force magnitude is

So the jet exerts about $785\ \text{N}$ on the plate.

The prototype surface speed is $6\ \text{m/s}$.

Which similarity condition should be matched, and what model speed follows from that choice?

For a free-surface flow, the key similarity condition is Froude similarity because gravity effects control the wave pattern and surface profile.

The back pressure is $200\ \text{kPa}$.

Determine whether the nozzle is choked. If it is, find the throat pressure and throat temperature.

For air, take $\gamma = 1.4$.

The critical pressure ratio for choking is

The back-pressure ratio is

$$
\frac{p_b}{p_0} = \frac{200}{500} = 0.40

Since $0.40 < 0.528$, the nozzle is choked.

At the throat, $\mathrm{Ma}=1$, so

p^* = 0.528(500\ \text{kPa}) \approx 264\ \text{kPa}

Also,

$$
\frac{T_0}{T^*} = 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}(1^2) = 1.2

So the largest back pressure that still allows choking is

$$
p_{b,\text{crit}} = 0.528(500\ \text{kPa}) \approx 264\ \text{kPa}
$$

At choking, the throat Mach number is $1$ and

$$
p^* \approx 264\ \text{kPa}
$$

Also,

$$
\frac{T_0}{T^*} = 1 + \frac{\gamma-1}{2}(1^2) = 1.2
$$

so

$$
T^* = \frac{300}{1.2} = 250\ \text{K}
$$
