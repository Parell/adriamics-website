A heat exchanger transfers heat from a hot stream to a cold stream.

The hot stream has $\dot{m}_h = 0.5\ \text{kg/s}$, $c_{p,h} = 4000\ \text{J/(kg K)}$, and cools from $90^\circ\text{C}$ to $60^\circ\text{C}$.

The cold stream has $\dot{m}_c = 1.0\ \text{kg/s}$ and $c_{p,c} = 3000\ \text{J/(kg K)}$.

If losses to the surroundings are negligible, what is the cold-stream outlet temperature?

Use the energy balance:

So

$$
\dot{Q} = 0.5(4000)(90 - 60) = 60000\ \text{W}

- Overall heat transfer coefficient $U = 350\ \text{W/(m}^2\text{ K)}$

What area is required?

Check the cold side:

0.7(3000)(70 - 20) = 105000\ \text{W}

Now find the terminal temperature differences:

$$
\Delta T_1 = T_{h,in} - T_{c,out} = 100 - 70 = 30
$$

$$
\Delta T_2 = T_{h,out} - T_{c,in} = 75 - 20 = 55

The log-mean temperature difference is

\Delta T_{lm} = \frac{\Delta T_2 - \Delta T_1}{\ln(\Delta T_2/\Delta T_1)}

$$
\Delta T_{lm} = \frac{55 - 30}{\ln(55/30)} \approx 41.2\ \text{K}

- Hot stream: $\dot{m}_h = 1.0\ \text{kg/s}$, $c_{p,h} = 4200\ \text{J/(kg K)}$, $100^\circ\text{C} \to 75^\circ\text{C}$
- Cold stream: $\dot{m}_c = 0.7\ \text{kg/s}$, $c_{p,c} = 3000\ \text{J/(kg K)}$, $20^\circ\text{C} \to 70^\circ\text{C}$
- Overall heat transfer coefficient $U = 350\ \text{W/(m}^2\text{ K)}$

What area is required?

:::solution
The heat transfer rate is

$$
\dot{Q} = 1.0(4200)(100 - 75) = 105000\ \text{W}
$$

The terminal temperature differences are

$$
\Delta T_1 = 100 - 70 = 30
$$

$$
\Delta T_2 = 75 - 20 = 55
$$

So the log-mean temperature difference is

$$
\Delta T_{lm} = \frac{55 - 30}{\ln(55/30)} \approx 41.2\ \text{K}
$$

Now solve for area:

$$
A = \frac{\dot{Q}}{U\Delta T_{lm}} = \frac{105000}{350(41.2)} \approx 7.3\ \text{m}^2

title: "Write the Governing Model for Radiation Cooling"
skills: [Radiation, Lumped Capacitance, Problem-Solving Workflow]
-->

A small object in a vacuum cools only by radiation to a large surrounding enclosure. The object is small enough that the lumped-capacitance model is valid.

What governing equation should you write for $T(t)$?

:::solution
Because the object is lumped, its temperature is uniform in space and depends only on time. The energy balance is

$$
mc_p\frac{dT}{dt} = -\varepsilon\sigma A\left(T^4 - T_{sur}^4\right)
$$

If you want a linearized network model, you can write

$$
mc_p\frac{dT}{dt} = -h_rA(T - T_{sur})
$$

with

$$
h_r \approx \varepsilon\sigma(T_s + T_{sur})(T_s^2 + T_{sur}^2)
$$

So the workflow is: identify radiation as the only mode, confirm lumped behavior, and then write the transient energy balance.
