Classify the signal below as continuous-time or discrete-time, and state whether it is deterministic or random:

$$
x(t) = e^{-2t}u(t)
$$

:::solution
The signal is **continuous-time** because it is defined for real values of $t$.

It is **deterministic** because it is given by an explicit formula, not a statistical description.

Let

$$

Find the even part $x_e(t)$ and odd part $x_o(t)$.

:::solution
First compute $x(-t)$:

$$
x(-t) = -t + 2
$$

Now use the formulas:

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{x(t) + x(-t)}{2}
$$

$$
x_o(t) = \frac{x(t) - x(-t)}{2}
$$

So

$$
x_e(t) = \frac{(t+2)+(-t+2)}{2} = 2
$$

and

$$
x_o(t) = \frac{(t+2)-(-t+2)}{2} = t

Is the system

$$
y(t) = x(t)^2
$$

linear?

:::solution
No. Linearity requires superposition.

For an input $x(t)$, the output is $x(t)^2$. But if we double the input, the output becomes

$$
(2x(t))^2 = 4x(t)^2
$$

whereas doubling the original output gives

$$
2x(t)^2
$$

These are not the same, so the system is not linear.

For the system

$$

state whether the system has memory and whether it is causal.

:::solution
The system **has memory** because $y(t)$ depends on $x(t-1)$, not just the input at the same time.

It is **causal** because it depends only on the present value $x(t)$ and the past value $x(t-1)$, not on any future input.

For an LTI system with impulse response $h(t)$, what is the output when the input is

$$
x(t) = \delta(t-2)?

:::solution
An impulse delayed by $2$ units produces a delayed copy of the impulse response:

Convolution with a delayed impulse shifts the other signal:

The system is **linear** because $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ appear only to the first power and are not multiplied together.

It is **time invariant** because the coefficients are constant and there is no explicit dependence on $t$.
