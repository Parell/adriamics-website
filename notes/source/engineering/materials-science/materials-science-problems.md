skills: [Stress, Units]

A tensile specimen carries a force of $12$ kN over an original area of $30$ mm$^2$.

What is the engineering stress?

:::solution
Use

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}
$$

so

$$
\sigma = \frac{12{,}000\ \text{N}}{30\ \text{mm}^2} = 400\ \text{N/mm}^2
$$

Since $1\ \text{N/mm}^2 = 1\ \text{MPa}$,

$$
\sigma = 400\ \text{MPa}
$$

An FCC metal has atomic radius $r = 0.125$ nm.

What is the unit-cell edge length?

:::solution
For FCC,

$$
a = 2\sqrt{2}\,r
$$

so

$$
a = 2\sqrt{2}(0.125) \approx 0.3536\ \text{nm}
$$

Thus,

$$
a \approx 0.354\ \text{nm}
$$

skills: [Hall-Petch, Grain-size strengthening]
-->

Material A has a grain size of $16\ \mu\text{m}$ and material B has a grain size of $4\ \mu\text{m}$.

According to the Hall-Petch relation, which material should have the higher yield strength, and how do the Hall-Petch terms compare?

:::solution
The Hall-Petch term is proportional to $d^{-1/2}$.

For material A:

$$
16^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{4}
$$

For material B:

$$
4^{-1/2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

So material B has the larger Hall-Petch term, by a factor of $2$.

Therefore, **material B** should have the higher yield strength.

title: "Use the Lever Rule for Phase Fractions"
skills: [Lever rule, Phase diagrams]
-->

At a temperature in a two-phase $\alpha+\beta$ region, suppose

$$
C_\alpha = 20\%, \quad C_\beta = 80\%, \quad C_0 = 50\%.
$$

Find the mass fractions of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.

:::solution
Use the lever rule:

$$
W_\alpha = \frac{C_\beta - C_0}{C_\beta - C_\alpha}
$$

and

$$
W_\beta = \frac{C_0 - C_\alpha}{C_\beta - C_\alpha}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
W_\alpha = \frac{80 - 50}{80 - 20} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5
$$

$$
W_\beta = \frac{50 - 20}{80 - 20} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5
$$

So the two phases are present in equal amounts.

skills: [Diffusion, Arrhenius relation]
-->

Using

$$
D = D_0 e^{-Q/RT},
$$

what happens to diffusivity when temperature increases and $D_0$ and $Q$ stay fixed?

:::solution
As $T$ increases, the quantity $-Q/RT$ becomes less negative, so the exponential term gets larger.

Therefore, **diffusivity increases** with temperature, and it usually increases rapidly because of the exponential dependence.

An alloy is in an $\alpha+\beta$ region with

$$
C_\alpha = 10\%, \quad C_\beta = 70\%, \quad C_0 = 34\%.
$$

Which phase is more abundant, and by how much?

:::solution
Use the lever rule:

$$
W_\alpha = \frac{C_\beta - C_0}{C_\beta - C_\alpha}
= \frac{70 - 34}{70 - 10}
= \frac{36}{60}
= 0.6
$$

$$
W_\beta = \frac{C_0 - C_\alpha}{C_\beta - C_\alpha}
= \frac{34 - 10}{70 - 10}
= \frac{24}{60}
= 0.4
$$

So $\alpha$ is more abundant, with a mass fraction of $0.6$ versus $0.4$ for $\beta$.

A component has stress $\sigma = 120$ MPa, crack size $a = 5$ mm, and geometry factor $Y = 1$.

If the fracture toughness is $K_{IC} = 16$ MPa$\sqrt{\text{m}}$, is the component safe by the crack-growth criterion in the note?

:::solution
Use

$$
K = Y\sigma\sqrt{\pi a}
$$

with $a = 5$ mm $= 0.005$ m:

$$
K = 1(120)\sqrt{\pi(0.005)}
$$

$$
K \approx 120 \times 0.125 = 15.0\ \text{MPa}\sqrt{\text{m}}
$$

Since

$$
15.0 < 16,
$$

the component is **safe by this criterion**.

A metal is made finer-grained and then cold-worked.

skills: [Martensite, Processing-structure-properties]

A rapid quench changes a steel microstructure to martensite.

Explain how the processing change leads to the property change.

:::solution
Rapid quenching suppresses diffusion, so the steel transforms into a **metastable martensitic structure** instead of a diffusion-controlled equilibrium structure.

That new structure is much harder, but also more brittle.

So the processing change leads to a structure change, which then changes properties.

Based on the note, what heat-treatment sequence best balances those requirements?
