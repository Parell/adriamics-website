# Materials Science
## 1. Core idea

Materials science studies how **structure**, **processing**, **properties**, and **performance** are linked.

The central idea is:

$$
\text{Processing} \rightarrow \text{Structure} \rightarrow \text{Properties} \rightarrow \text{Performance}
$$

If you change the processing route, you change the microstructure. Microstructure changes properties such as strength, ductility, conductivity, corrosion resistance, and toughness.

### Scales of structure

- Atomic scale: bonding, lattice type, composition
- Microstructural scale: grains, phases, precipitates, defects
- Macroscopic scale: shape, texture, residual stress, component geometry

### Why it matters

Engineering failures and design tradeoffs usually come from a mismatch among:

- loading conditions
- operating environment
- processing history
- required lifetime and reliability

## 2. Atomic structure and bonding

### Bonding types

| Bond type | Main feature | Typical materials | Consequences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ionic | Electron transfer between atoms | Ceramics, salts | Hard, brittle, high melting point |
| Covalent | Shared electron pairs | Diamond, Si, polymers | Directional bonding, often strong |
| Metallic | Delocalized electrons | Metals and alloys | Electrical conductivity, ductility |
| Secondary | Van der Waals, hydrogen bonding | Polymers, molecular solids | Lower strength, lower melting point |

Bond strength strongly affects melting temperature, modulus, thermal expansion, and diffusion rate.

### Interatomic potential

Equilibrium spacing occurs where attractive and repulsive forces balance.

Key trends:

- deeper energy well means stronger bonding
- steeper curvature near equilibrium means higher elastic modulus
- weaker bonding usually means lower melting point and lower stiffness

### Properties influenced by bonding

- Metals: good conductivity, ductility, opaque
- Ceramics: stiff, hard, brittle, insulating
- Polymers: low density, low stiffness, viscoelastic behavior

## 3. Crystal structures

### Common crystal lattices

| Structure | Atoms per unit cell | Coordination number | Packing factor | Examples |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Simple cubic (SC) | 1 | 6 | 0.52 | Rare in engineering |
| Body-centered cubic (BCC) | 2 | 8 | 0.68 | $\alpha$-Fe, Cr, W |
| Face-centered cubic (FCC) | 4 | 12 | 0.74 | Al, Cu, Ni, Au |
| Hexagonal close-packed (HCP) | 6 | 12 | 0.74 | Mg, Ti, Zn |

### Useful relations

For cubic structures:

$$
a = 2r \quad \text{(SC)}
$$

$$
a = \frac{4r}{\sqrt{3}} \quad \text{(BCC)}
$$

$$
a = \frac{4r}{\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2}\,r \quad \text{(FCC)}
$$

where:

- $a$ is the unit-cell edge length
- $r$ is the atomic radius

### Miller indices

Miller indices describe crystallographic planes and directions.

Use them to identify:

- slip systems
- cleavage planes
- anisotropy
- preferred growth or fracture paths

### Polycrystals

Most engineering metals are polycrystalline: many grains with different orientations.

Important terms:

- grain: one crystal region
- grain boundary: interface between grains
- texture: preferred orientation distribution

Grain boundaries strengthen materials by impeding dislocation motion, but they can also affect corrosion and diffusion.

## 4. Defects and diffusion

### Point defects

- Vacancy: missing atom
- Interstitial: atom in an interstitial site
- Substitutional impurity: foreign atom replaces a host atom

Defects are not always undesirable. They often enable:

- diffusion
- solid-solution strengthening
- semiconductor doping
- ionic conduction

### Line and planar defects

- Dislocations: line defects that enable plastic deformation
- Grain boundaries: planar defects
- Twin boundaries and stacking faults: important in FCC/HCP behavior

### Dislocations

Two main types:

- edge dislocation
- screw dislocation

Dislocations reduce the stress needed for plastic flow compared with perfect crystals.

The Burgers vector magnitude, $b$, measures lattice distortion and is a key scale factor in strengthening.

### Diffusion

Atoms migrate from high chemical potential to low chemical potential.

Fick's first law:

$$
J = -D \frac{dC}{dx}
$$

where:

- $J$ is diffusion flux
- $D$ is diffusivity
- $C$ is concentration

Fick's second law:

$$
\frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 C}{\partial x^2}
$$

Temperature dependence of diffusivity:

$$
D = D_0 e^{-Q/RT}
$$

with:

- $D_0$ pre-exponential factor
- $Q$ activation energy
- $R$ gas constant
- $T$ absolute temperature

Higher temperature usually increases diffusion dramatically.

### Why diffusion matters

Diffusion controls:

- carburizing and nitriding
- precipitation hardening
- sintering
- creep
- oxidation

## 5. Phase diagrams and phase transformations

### Phase concept

A phase is a physically distinct region with uniform structure and composition.

Common phase types:

- solid solution
- liquid
- intermetallic compound
- mixture of phases

### Binary phase diagrams

Read phase diagrams by locating the alloy composition and temperature, then identifying the phase field.

Useful steps:

1. Find the overall alloy composition.
2. Draw a horizontal tie line at the temperature of interest.
3. Read phase compositions from the ends of the tie line.
4. Use the lever rule for phase fractions.

### Lever rule

For a two-phase region with phases $\alpha$ and $\beta$:

$$
W_\alpha = \frac{C_\beta - C_0}{C_\beta - C_\alpha}
$$

$$
W_\beta = \frac{C_0 - C_\alpha}{C_\beta - C_\alpha}
$$

where:

- $W_\alpha$, $W_\beta$ are mass fractions
- $C_0$ is overall composition
- $C_\alpha$, $C_\beta$ are phase compositions

### Eutectic, eutectoid, and peritectic reactions

- Eutectic: liquid transforms to two solids
- Eutectoid: one solid transforms to two solids
- Peritectic: liquid plus solid transforms to a different solid

These reactions are important because they create characteristic microstructures and mechanical properties.

### Iron-carbon system

The Fe-C system is central to steels and cast irons.

Key phases:

- ferrite ($\alpha$): BCC iron, soft and ductile
- austenite ($\gamma$): FCC iron, higher carbon solubility
- cementite ($\mathrm{Fe_3C}$): hard and brittle
- pearlite: lamellar mixture of ferrite and cementite
- bainite: fine microstructure formed by transformation at intermediate temperatures
- martensite: supersaturated, very hard phase formed by rapid quenching

### Time-temperature-transformation ideas

Transformation products depend not only on composition and temperature but also on time.

General rule:

- slow cooling favors diffusion-controlled products
- rapid quenching can suppress diffusion and form metastable phases

## 6. Mechanical behavior

### Stress and strain

Engineering stress:

$$
\sigma = \frac{F}{A_0}
$$

Engineering strain:

$$
\varepsilon = \frac{L - L_0}{L_0}
$$

True stress and true strain are more accurate at large deformation:

$$
\sigma_t = \frac{F}{A}
$$

$$
\varepsilon_t = \ln\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)
$$

### Elastic deformation

In the linear elastic range:

$$
\sigma = E\varepsilon
$$

where $E$ is Young's modulus.

Related elastic constants:

- shear modulus, $G$
- bulk modulus, $K$
- Poisson's ratio, $\nu$

For isotropic materials:

$$
E = 2G(1+\nu)
$$

### Plastic deformation

Plasticity begins when dislocations move irreversibly.

Typical features of a tensile test curve:

- elastic region
- yield point or yield strength
- strain hardening
- ultimate tensile strength
- necking
- fracture

### Ductility and toughness

- Ductility measures how much plastic strain occurs before fracture.
- Toughness is energy absorbed before fracture, roughly the area under the stress-strain curve.

### Hardness

Hardness is resistance to localized plastic deformation.

Common tests:

- Brinell
- Rockwell
- Vickers

Hardness often correlates with strength, but the exact relation depends on material class and microstructure.

### Fracture

Two broad fracture modes:

- ductile fracture: large plastic deformation, microvoid coalescence
- brittle fracture: little plastic deformation, rapid crack propagation

Fracture mechanics focuses on crack size, geometry, and stress intensity.

Stress intensity:

$$
K = Y \sigma \sqrt{\pi a}
$$

where:

- $Y$ is a geometry factor
- $a$ is crack size

If $K$ reaches the critical toughness $K_{IC}$, unstable crack growth may occur.

### Fatigue

Fatigue is failure under cyclic loading, often below yield strength.

Important concepts:

- stress amplitude
- mean stress
- number of cycles to failure, $N_f$
- S-N curve
- fatigue limit for some steels

### Creep

Creep is time-dependent plastic deformation at elevated temperature.

Stages:

- primary creep: decreasing rate
- secondary creep: nearly steady rate
- tertiary creep: accelerating rate toward failure

<a id="heat-treatment-and-strengthening"></a>
## 7. Heat treatment and strengthening

### Strengthening mechanisms

- Grain-size strengthening
- Solid-solution strengthening
- Strain hardening
- Precipitation hardening
- Transformation strengthening

### Hall-Petch relation

Smaller grains generally increase yield strength:

$$
\sigma_y = \sigma_0 + k_y d^{-1/2}
$$

where:

- $d$ is grain diameter
- $\sigma_0$ is friction stress
- $k_y$ is a material constant

### Strain hardening

Plastic deformation increases dislocation density, making further slip more difficult.

Consequences:

- higher yield strength
- lower ductility
- higher hardness

### Precipitation hardening

This is a major strengthening route in many aluminum alloys, nickel alloys, and steels.

Typical sequence:

1. Solution heat treat to dissolve solute.
2. Quench to retain a supersaturated solid solution.
3. Age to form fine precipitates.

Fine, coherent precipitates impede dislocation motion effectively. Overaging can reduce strength as precipitates coarsen.

### Steel heat treatment

Common heat-treatment operations:

- annealing: soften and relieve stress
- normalizing: refine grain structure
- quenching: increase hardness
- tempering: reduce brittleness after quench

The balance between hardness and toughness is usually controlled by temperature, time, and cooling rate.

Why use composites:

- high specific strength
- high specific stiffness

- better fatigue or corrosion performance in selected designs

### Semiconductors

Semiconductors occupy the middle ground between conductors and insulators.

Key ideas:

- band gap
- doping
- carriers: electrons and holes
- temperature-sensitive conductivity

Materials science and electronic behavior are closely linked in devices and power systems.

<a id="characterization-and-testing"></a>
## 9. Characterization and testing

### Microstructure characterization

Common tools:

- optical microscopy
- scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
- transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
- X-ray diffraction (XRD)
- electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)
- atomic force microscopy (AFM)

### What each method is good for

| Method | Best for | Typical output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Optical microscopy | Grain structure, phases at moderate scale | Grain size, phase distribution |
| SEM | Surface and fracture features | Morphology, composition contrast |
| TEM | Nanoscale defects and precipitates | Dislocations, interfaces |
| XRD | Crystal structure and phase identification | Lattice spacing, phase map |
| EBSD | Grain orientation and texture | Orientation map |

### Mechanical tests

- tension
- compression
- torsion
- hardness
- impact
- fatigue
- creep

The test method must match the failure mode of interest.

### Chemical and environmental tests

- corrosion testing
- oxidation testing
- wear testing
- thermal cycling

These tests matter because performance usually depends on service environment, not just static strength.

<a id="materials-selection"></a>
## 10. Materials selection

Materials selection is a constrained optimization problem.

You are usually balancing:

- strength
- stiffness
- toughness
- density
- conductivity
- corrosion resistance
- cost
- manufacturability
- sustainability

### Selection workflow

1. Define the function of the part.
2. Identify loading, temperature, environment, and lifetime.
3. Set constraints that cannot be violated.
4. Rank objectives such as mass, cost, or performance.
5. Screen candidate materials.
6. Compare processing routes and joining options.
7. Validate with prototypes and testing.

### Common engineering tradeoffs

- Higher strength often reduces ductility.
- Lower density can reduce stiffness unless geometry is adjusted.
- Better corrosion resistance may increase cost.
- Higher temperature capability often comes with higher processing difficulty.

### Process selection

The best material is not useful if it cannot be fabricated economically.

Processing constraints include:

- casting
- forging
- rolling
- extrusion
- additive manufacturing
- machining
- heat treatment
- welding or bonding

<a id="problem-solving-workflow"></a>
## 11. Problem-solving workflow

For exam or design problems, use a disciplined sequence.

### Step-by-step approach

1. Identify the material class and relevant microstructure.
2. Determine whether the problem is about structure, phase, mechanics, or diffusion.
3. Write down known variables and units.
4. Sketch the physical situation or phase diagram.
5. Choose the governing relation.
6. Check whether assumptions are valid.
7. Compute the result with consistent units.
8. Interpret whether the answer is physically plausible.

### Common equations to recognize quickly

- stress and strain relations
- Hooke's law
- lever rule
- Fick's laws
- Hall-Petch relation
- Arrhenius diffusivity
- fracture toughness relation

### Dimensional checks

Always verify units:

- stress: Pa
- strain: dimensionless
- diffusivity: $\mathrm{m^2/s}$
- fracture toughness: $\mathrm{Pa}\sqrt{\mathrm{m}}$

If the units do not match, the setup is wrong even if the arithmetic is right.

## 13. Common pitfalls

- Confusing phase composition with overall alloy composition.
- Using engineering stress after severe necking without checking assumptions.
- Forgetting that stronger materials are not always tougher.
- Treating all strengthening mechanisms as equivalent.
- Reading a phase diagram without drawing a tie line.
- Ignoring time in diffusion and heat treatment problems.
- Mixing up brittle fracture with fatigue fracture.
- Using the wrong unit-cell relation for the crystal structure.
- Assuming the same material behaves identically across temperature ranges.

### Quick sanity checks

- Does the trend match the mechanism?
- Does the microstructure explain the property?
- Are units consistent?
- Is the process realistic for the alloy or component?
- Did you account for temperature, time, and environment?

### Final takeaway

Materials science is about selecting and designing materials by controlling structure at multiple scales. The best answers usually connect atomic bonding, defects, phase behavior, processing history, and the final service conditions of the part.
