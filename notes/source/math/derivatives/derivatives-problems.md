What does $f'(a)$ tell you geometrically about the graph of $y=f(x)$?

:::solution
Geometrically, $f'(a)$ is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at $x=a$.

It also describes the function's instantaneous rate of change at that point.

Let

$$
f(x)=x^2.
$$

Use the limit definition of the derivative to find $f'(x)$.

:::solution
Start with the definition:

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

Substitute $f(x)=x^2$:

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x+h)^2-x^2}{h}
$$

Expand the numerator:

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{x^2+2xh+h^2-x^2}{h}
$$

Simplify:

$$
f'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2xh+h^2}{h}
=\lim_{h\to 0}(2x+h)
$$

Now take the limit:

$$
f'(x)=2x

Let $f=x^2$ and $g=e^x$. Then $f'=2x$ and $g'=e^x$.

Use the quotient rule:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{f}{g}\right]

\frac{f'g-fg'}{g^2}
$$

Let $f=x^2+1$ and $g=x$. Then $f'=2x$ and $g'=1$.

So

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left[\frac{x^2+1}{x}\right]

Treat the inside as the inner function. The derivative of $\sin u$ is $\cos u$, and the derivative of $x^3$ is $3x^2$.

The derivative of $\ln u$ is $\frac{1}{u}u'$.

Here,

Differentiate each term with respect to $x$:

Use the product rule on $xy$ and the chain rule on $y^2$:

$$
2x+y+x\frac{dy}{dx}+2y\frac{dy}{dx}=0
$$

Group the $\frac{dy}{dx}$ terms:

Use the linear approximation of $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ at $x=16$ to estimate $\sqrt{16.2}$.

:::solution
For $f(x)=\sqrt{x}$,

$$
f(16)=4

and

$$
f'(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}

so

$$
f'(16)=\frac{1}{8}

The linearization at $x=16$ is

L(x)=4+\frac{1}{8}(x-16)

Evaluate at $x=16.2$:

$$
L(16.2)=4+\frac{1}{8}(0.2)=4.025

Suppose

$$

$$

On which intervals is $f$ increasing and on which intervals is it decreasing?

:::solution
First find the critical numbers from $f'(x)=0$:

$$
3(x-2)(x+1)=0
$$

So the critical numbers are $x=-1$ and $x=2$.

Check the sign of $f'(x)$ on each interval:

- If $x<-1$, then both factors are negative, so $f'(x)>0$.
- If $-1<x<2$, then one factor is negative and one is positive, so $f'(x)<0$.
- If $x>2$, then both factors are positive, so $f'(x)>0$.

Therefore, $f$ is increasing on

$$
(-\infty,-1)\cup(2,\infty)

and decreasing on

(-1,2).

A circle's radius is increasing at a rate of $0.5$ cm/s. How fast is the area changing when the radius is $10$ cm?

Use the area formula

Differentiate with respect to time:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi r\frac{dr}{dt}
$$

Substitute $r=10$ and $\frac{dr}{dt}=0.5$:

$$
\frac{dA}{dt}=2\pi(10)(0.5)=10\pi

A rectangle has perimeter $40$ m. What dimensions give the maximum area?

Let the side lengths be $x$ and $y$.

The perimeter condition is

$$
2x+2y=40

so

$$
y=20-x
$$

The area is

$$
A(x)=x(20-x)=20x-x^2

Differentiate:

$$
A'(x)=20-2x
$$

Set the derivative equal to zero:

$$
20-2x=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
x=10
$$

Then

$$
y=20-10=10

So the rectangle with maximum area is a $10$ m by $10$ m square.

For a circle,

Show that

f(x)=|x|
$$

is continuous at $x=0$ but not differentiable there.

:::solution
First check continuity:

$$
\lim_{x\to 0}|x|=0=f(0)
$$

so $f$ is continuous at $0$.

Now check differentiability using one-sided slopes. For $x>0$, $f(x)=x$, so the right-hand derivative at $0$ is

$$
\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{|x|-|0|}{x-0}
=\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{x}{x}=1
$$

For $x<0$, $f(x)=-x$, so the left-hand derivative at $0$ is

$$
\lim_{x\to 0^-}\frac{|x|-|0|}{x-0}
=\lim_{x\to 0^-}\frac{-x}{x}=-1
$$

The one-sided derivatives are not equal, so $f'(0)$ does not exist.

For

$$

find the critical points, classify them, and identify an inflection point.

:::solution
Differentiate once:

$$
f'(x)=3x^2-3=3(x-1)(x+1)

So the critical points occur at

x=-1 \quad \text{and} \quad x=1
$$

Differentiate again:

$$
f''(x)=6x
$$

At $x=-1$,

$$
f''(-1)=-6<0
$$

so $x=-1$ is a local maximum.

At $x=1$,

$$
f''(1)=6>0
$$

so $x=1$ is a local minimum.

For an inflection point, check where concavity changes. Since

$$
f''(x)=6x
$$

changes sign at $x=0$, there is an inflection point at $x=0$.

A rectangular pen is built against a straight wall, so only three sides need fencing. If $24$ m of fencing are available, what dimensions maximize the area?

:::solution
Let $x$ be the two equal sides perpendicular to the wall, and let $y$ be the side parallel to the wall.

The fencing constraint is

The area is

Differentiate:

$$
A'(x)=24-4x
$$

Set the derivative equal to zero:

$$
24-4x=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
x=6

Then

$$
y=24-2(6)=12
