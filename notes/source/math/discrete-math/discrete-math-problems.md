Write the negation of the statement:

$$
\forall n \in \mathbb{Z},\ n \text{ prime } \to n \text{ odd}
$$

:::solution
The negation of $\forall n\, P(n)$ is $\exists n\, \neg P(n)$.

Here $P(n)$ is the implication "if $n$ is prime, then $n$ is odd." The negation of an implication is:

$$
p \to q \equiv \neg p \lor q
$$

so its negation is:

$$
p \land \neg q
$$

Therefore the negation is:

$$
\exists n \in \mathbb{Z},\ n \text{ is prime and } n \text{ is not odd}
$$

Equivalently, there exists an integer $n$ that is prime and even.

skills: [Implication, Contrapositive]
---

Write the contrapositive of the statement:

$$
\text{If } n \text{ is divisible by } 4,\text{ then } n \text{ is even.}
$$

:::solution
For a statement $p \to q$, the contrapositive is $\neg q \to \neg p$.

Here:

- $p$: $n$ is divisible by $4$
- $q$: $n$ is even

So the contrapositive is:

$$
\text{If } n \text{ is not even, then } n \text{ is not divisible by } 4.
$$

Since integers are either even or odd, this can also be written as:

$$
\text{If } n \text{ is odd, then } n \text{ is not divisible by } 4.

Let $f : \{1,2,3\} \to \{a,b\}$ be defined by

$$
f(1)=a,\quad f(2)=b,\quad f(3)=a.
$$

Is $f$ injective, surjective, both, or neither?

:::solution
The function is **not injective** because different inputs can give the same output:

$$
f(1)=a \quad \text{and} \quad f(3)=a
$$

The function is **surjective** because both elements of the codomain are hit:

$$
a \text{ is hit by } 1 \text{ and } 3,\quad b \text{ is hit by } 2
$$

So $f$ is surjective but not injective.

- Antisymmetric: there is no pair $(a,b)$ and $(b,a)$ with $a \neq b$.

---

Consider the relation on integers defined by

$$
a \sim b \iff a \equiv b \pmod 4.
$$

Explain why this is an equivalence relation, and describe the equivalence class of $7$.

:::solution
Congruence modulo $4$ is:

- Reflexive, because $a \equiv a \pmod 4$
- Symmetric, because if $a \equiv b \pmod 4$, then $b \equiv a \pmod 4$
- Transitive, because if $a \equiv b \pmod 4$ and $b \equiv c \pmod 4$, then $a \equiv c \pmod 4$

So it is an equivalence relation.

The class of $7$ is all integers congruent to $7$ mod $4$, which is the same as all integers congruent to $3$ mod $4$:

$$
[7] = \{\dots,-5,-1,3,7,11,15,\dots\}

Prove that if $n^2$ is even, then $n$ is even.

:::solution
Use the contrapositive: prove that if $n$ is odd, then $n^2$ is odd.

If $n$ is odd, then $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k$. Then

$$
n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1
$$

which is odd.

So the contrapositive is true, and therefore the original statement is true.

skills: [Induction, Summation]

Use mathematical induction to prove that

$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

for all $n \ge 1$.

:::solution
Base case $n=1$:

$$
1 = \frac{1 \cdot 2}{2}
$$

so the formula holds.

Inductive step: assume the formula holds for $n=k$:

$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}
$$

Then

$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + k + (k+1)
= \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1)
$$

Factor out $(k+1)$:

$$
= (k+1)\left(\frac{k}{2} + 1\right)
= (k+1)\left(\frac{k+2}{2}\right)
= \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}
$$

This is exactly the formula with $n=k+1$. Therefore the statement holds for all $n \ge 1$.

Prove that every integer $n \ge 2$ can be written as a product of primes.

:::solution
We use strong induction.

Base case: $n=2$. The number $2$ is prime, so it is already a product of primes.

Inductive step: assume every integer from $2$ through $k$ can be written as a product of primes. We prove the claim for $k+1$.

- If $k+1$ is prime, then it is already a product of primes.
- If $k+1$ is composite, then

$$
k+1 = ab
$$

for some integers $a,b$ with

$$
2 \le a \le k,\quad 2 \le b \le k
$$

By the strong inductive hypothesis, both $a$ and $b$ can be written as products of primes. Multiplying those factorizations gives a product of primes for $k+1$.

Therefore every integer $n \ge 2$ can be written as a product of primes.

How many integers from $1$ to $100$ are divisible by $2$, $3$, or $5$?

:::solution
Use inclusion-exclusion.

Counts of multiples:

\left\lfloor \frac{100}{3} \right\rfloor = 33,\quad
\left\lfloor \frac{100}{5} \right\rfloor = 20

Subtract overlaps:

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{100}{6} \right\rfloor = 16,\quad
\left\lfloor \frac{100}{10} \right\rfloor = 10,\quad
\left\lfloor \frac{100}{15} \right\rfloor = 6
$$

Add back the triple overlap:

$$
\left\lfloor \frac{100}{30} \right\rfloor = 3
$$

So the total is

$$
50 + 33 + 20 - 16 - 10 - 6 + 3 = 74

:::solution
A good loop invariant is:

> After the loop has processed the numbers $1,2,\dots,k$, the variable `total` equals $1+2+\cdots+k$.

Why it works:

- Before the loop starts, `total = 0`, which matches the sum of no terms.
- Each iteration adds the next integer, so if the invariant is true before an iteration, it remains true after that iteration.
- When the loop finishes, $k=n$, so `total` equals

$$
1 + 2 + \cdots + n
$$

Therefore the algorithm is correct.
