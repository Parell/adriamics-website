# Geometry
# 1. Foundations and notation

Geometry studies shape, size, position, and relationships in the plane and in space.

Core undefined terms:

- Point: location with no size
- Line: infinite straight path
- Plane: flat two-dimensional surface

Common notation:

- Segment: $\overline{AB}$
- Ray: $\overrightarrow{AB}$
- Line through $A$ and $B$: $\overleftrightarrow{AB}$
- Length of segment $AB$: $AB$
- Angle $ABC$: $\angle ABC$

## Basic ideas

- A line segment has length, a line does not.
- An angle is formed by two rays with a common endpoint.
- A polygon is a closed figure made of line segments.
- A circle is the set of points a fixed distance from a center.

## Postulates and theorems you use constantly

- Through any two points there is exactly one line.
- A segment can be measured and compared.
- A circle can be drawn with any center and radius.
- All right angles are congruent.
- If two lines intersect, vertical angles are congruent.

# 2. Angles, lines, and parallelism

## Angle types

| Type | Measure |
| --- | ---: |
| Acute | $0^\circ < \theta < 90^\circ$ |
| Right | $90^\circ$ |
| Obtuse | $90^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ$ |
| Straight | $180^\circ$ |
| Reflex | $180^\circ < \theta < 360^\circ$ |

## Angle relationships

- Complementary angles sum to $90^\circ$.
- Supplementary angles sum to $180^\circ$.
- Vertical angles are congruent.
- Linear pairs are supplementary.

If a line cuts two parallel lines, then:

- Corresponding angles are congruent.
- Alternate interior angles are congruent.
- Same-side interior angles are supplementary.

## Slope intuition for parallel and perpendicular lines

In coordinate geometry:

- Parallel lines have equal slope.
- Perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is $-1$, when both slopes are defined.

If a line has slope $m$, a perpendicular line has slope

$$
m_\perp = -\frac{1}{m}
$$

when $m \ne 0$.

# 3. Triangles

Triangles are central because many geometric problems reduce to triangle relationships.

## Angle sum and exterior angles

For any triangle:

$$
A + B + C = 180^\circ
$$

An exterior angle equals the sum of the two remote interior angles:

$$
m\angle ext = m\angle 1 + m\angle 2
$$

## Special triangles

### Isosceles triangle

- Two sides are congruent.
- Base angles are congruent.
- The altitude from the vertex to the base bisects the base and the vertex angle.

### Equilateral triangle

- All sides are congruent.
- All angles are $60^\circ$.

### Right triangle

- One angle is $90^\circ$.
- The side opposite the right angle is the hypotenuse.

## Triangle inequality

For side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$:

$$
a+b>c,\quad a+c>b,\quad b+c>a
$$

A triangle exists only if the sum of any two side lengths is greater than the third.

## Medians, altitudes, angle bisectors, and perpendicular bisectors

- A median connects a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.
- An altitude is perpendicular to the opposite side or its extension.
- An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal angles.
- A perpendicular bisector is perpendicular to a segment and passes through its midpoint.

Key fact:

- The perpendicular bisector of a segment contains all points equidistant from the segment's endpoints.

# 4. Congruence and similarity

## Congruence

Figures are congruent if they have the same shape and size. Congruent figures can be matched by rigid motions.

Triangle congruence criteria:

- SSS: three corresponding sides congruent
- SAS: two sides and the included angle congruent
- ASA: two angles and the included side congruent
- AAS: two angles and a non-included side congruent
- HL: hypotenuse and one leg of right triangles congruent

## Similarity

Figures are similar if they have the same shape and proportional side lengths.

Triangle similarity criteria:

- AA: two angles congruent
- SAS: proportional sides with included angle congruent
- SSS: all corresponding sides proportional

If triangles are similar with scale factor $k$, then:

- Corresponding side lengths scale by $k$
- Perimeters scale by $k$
- Areas scale by $k^2$

## Common uses

- Indirect measurement
- Proportional reasoning in maps and scale drawings
- Solving unknown lengths in nested shapes

Example pattern:

If $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle DEF$, then

$$
\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{BC}{EF}=\frac{AC}{DF}
$$

and corresponding angles are equal.

# 5. Right triangles and trigonometry

## Pythagorean theorem

For a right triangle with legs $a$ and $b$ and hypotenuse $c$:

$$
a^2+b^2=c^2
$$

Common triples:

- $3,4,5$
- $5,12,13$
- $8,15,17$
- $7,24,25$

## Distance and midpoint

For points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$:

$$
d=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}
$$

Midpoint:

$$
M=\left(\frac{x_1+x_2}{2},\frac{y_1+y_2}{2}\right)
$$

## Basic trigonometric ratios

In a right triangle:

$$
\sin\theta=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

$$
\cos\theta=\frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
$$

$$
\tan\theta=\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
$$

Use trig when the problem involves an angle and a side length that is not directly reachable with similarity or the Pythagorean theorem.

# 6. Quadrilaterals and polygons

## Quadrilateral families

| Shape | Defining properties |
| --- | --- |
| Parallelogram | Opposite sides parallel and congruent; opposite angles congruent |
| Rectangle | A parallelogram with four right angles |
| Rhombus | A parallelogram with four congruent sides |
| Square | Both a rectangle and a rhombus |
| Trapezoid | At least one pair of parallel sides |
| Kite | Two pairs of adjacent congruent sides |

Important parallelogram facts:

- Diagonals bisect each other.
- Opposite sides are parallel.
- Opposite angles are equal.

## Polygon angle sums

For an $n$-gon, the sum of interior angles is:

$$
(n-2)180^\circ
$$

Each interior angle of a regular $n$-gon is:

$$
\frac{(n-2)180^\circ}{n}
$$

Each exterior angle of a regular $n$-gon is:

$$
\frac{360^\circ}{n}
$$

The exterior angles of any polygon sum to $360^\circ$.

# 7. Circles

## Core definitions

- Center: fixed point in the middle
- Radius: segment from center to circle
- Diameter: chord through the center, equal to $2r$
- Chord: segment connecting two points on the circle
- Secant: line intersecting the circle at two points
- Tangent: line touching the circle at exactly one point

## Circle relationships

- A radius is perpendicular to a tangent at the point of tangency.
- Congruent circles have equal radii.
- Equal chords in the same circle subtend equal arcs and equal central angles.

## Angle measures in circles

- Central angle measure equals its intercepted arc.
- Inscribed angle measure is half its intercepted arc.

If an inscribed angle intercepts arc $\widehat{AB}$, then

$$
m\angle ACB=\frac{1}{2}m\widehat{AB}
$$

## Arc and sector length

Arc length:

$$
s=\frac{\theta}{360^\circ}\cdot 2\pi r
$$

Sector area:

$$
A=\frac{\theta}{360^\circ}\cdot \pi r^2
$$

## Power of a point

Useful circle facts:

- Tangent segments from the same external point are congruent.
- Intersecting chords satisfy

$$
a\cdot b=c\cdot d
$$

- For two secants from one external point:

$$
(\text{external})(\text{whole})=(\text{external})(\text{whole})
$$

- For a tangent and a secant:

$$
(\text{tangent})^2=(\text{external})(\text{whole})
$$

# 8. Coordinate geometry

Coordinate geometry lets you translate geometric questions into algebra.

## Line formulas

Slope between two points:

$$
m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}
$$

Slope-intercept form:

$$
y=mx+b
$$

Point-slope form:

$$
y-y_1=m(x-x_1)
$$

## Equation of a circle

Circle centered at $(h,k)$ with radius $r$:

$$
(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2
$$

## Common coordinate proofs

- Show two segments are congruent by comparing distances.
- Show a midpoint or bisector by using midpoint formula or equal slopes.
- Show perpendicularity using negative reciprocal slopes.
- Show parallelism using equal slopes.

---

# 9. Transformations and symmetry

## Rigid motions

Rigid motions preserve distance and angle measure:

- Translation
- Rotation
- Reflection

Because rigid motions preserve size and shape, they prove congruence.

## Dilations

A dilation changes size but preserves shape.

If the scale factor is $k$:

- Lengths multiply by $k$
- Areas multiply by $k^2$
- Volumes multiply by $k^3$

## Symmetry

- Line symmetry: a figure matches itself across a line
- Rotational symmetry: a figure matches itself after a rotation less than $360^\circ$

Symmetry is often a shortcut for finding equal lengths, angles, or missing parts.

# 10. Area, perimeter, surface area, and volume

## Perimeter and area

| Figure | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Rectangle | $A=lw$ |
| Square | $A=s^2$ |
| Triangle | $A=\frac12 bh$ |
| Parallelogram | $A=bh$ |
| Trapezoid | $A=\frac12(b_1+b_2)h$ |
| Circle | $A=\pi r^2$ |

## Common volumes

| Solid | Formula |
| --- | --- |
| Rectangular prism | $V=lwh$ |
| Prism | $V=Bh$ |
| Cylinder | $V=\pi r^2h$ |
| Pyramid | $V=\frac13Bh$ |
| Cone | $V=\frac13\pi r^2h$ |
| Sphere | $V=\frac43\pi r^3$ |

## Surface area mindset

Surface area is the total area of all outer faces. A reliable method is:

1. Unfold or visualize the net.
2. Compute each face separately.
3. Add all exposed areas.
4. Check for shared faces or overlaps.

---

# 11. Proof strategies and problem-solving workflow

## Common proof tools

- Definitions: use the meaning of congruent, midpoint, bisector, tangent, and so on.
- Algebra: substitute known equalities and solve equations.
- CPCTC: corresponding parts of congruent triangles are congruent.
- Similar triangles: use proportional sides and equal angles.
- Circle theorems: use radii, tangents, arcs, and inscribed angles.
- Coordinate methods: use slopes, distances, and equations.

## Clean problem-solving workflow

1. Sketch the figure and label all givens.
2. Identify the topic: triangles, circles, similarity, coordinates, or transformations.
3. Mark equal angles, equal lengths, parallel lines, or right angles.
4. Choose the shortest path:
   - Pythagorean theorem for right triangles
   - Similarity for proportions
   - Angle chasing for unknown angles
   - Coordinate formulas for algebraic setups
5. Write equations from the marked relationships.
6. Solve carefully and verify the result fits the geometry.

## Common pitfalls

- Mixing up diameter and radius
- Using the Pythagorean theorem on a non-right triangle
- Forgetting that similar figures have area scale factor $k^2$, not $k$
- Assuming lines are parallel or perpendicular without evidence
- Using degrees and radians inconsistently in circle work
