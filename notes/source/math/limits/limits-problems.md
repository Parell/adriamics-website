Evaluate the limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 4} (2x^2 - 3x + 1)
$$

:::solution
Because polynomials are continuous, substitute $x=4$ directly:

$$
2(4^2) - 3(4) + 1 = 32 - 12 + 1 = 21
$$

So the limit is $21$.

Evaluate the limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}
$$

:::solution
Factor the numerator:

$$
x^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)
$$

For $x \ne 1$,

$$
\frac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1} = x + 1
$$

Now substitute $x=1$:

$$
1 + 1 = 2
$$

So the limit is $2$.

Let

f(x)=
\begin{cases}
1, & x<2 \\
5, & x\ge 2

What is $\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x)$?

Approaching $2$ from the left means $x<2$, so the rule $f(x)=1$ applies.

Therefore,

$$
\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x)=1
$$

skills: [Oscillation, Limits That Do Not Exist]
-->

Does the limit exist?

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} \sin\!\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)
$$

:::solution
No. As $x$ gets close to $0$, the inside value $\frac{1}{x}$ grows without bound, so the sine function keeps oscillating between $-1$ and $1$.

Since it does not approach a single value, the limit does not exist.

Evaluate the limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{5x^2 + 1}{2x^2 - 7}
$$

:::solution
The numerator and denominator have the same degree, so the limit is the ratio of leading coefficients:

So the limit is $\frac{5}{2}$.

skills: [Infinite Limits, Vertical Asymptotes]

Evaluate the limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{1}{(x-2)^2}
$$

:::solution
As $x$ approaches $2$, the denominator $(x-2)^2$ approaches $0$ through positive values.

So the fraction grows without bound:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{1}{(x-2)^2}=+\infty
$$

This means $x=2$ is a vertical asymptote.

Evaluate the limit:

$$

:::solution
Polynomials are continuous, so substitute $x=2$:

$$
2^3 - 4(2) + 1 = 8 - 8 + 1 = 1
$$

So the limit is $1$.

Evaluate the limit:

:::solution
Multiply by the conjugate:

$$
\frac{\sqrt{x} - 3}{x - 9}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{x} + 3}{\sqrt{x} + 3}
= \frac{1}{\sqrt{x}+3}
$$

Now substitute $x=9$:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{9}+3}=\frac{1}{6}
$$

So the limit is $\frac{1}{6}$.

What value of $k$ makes $f$ continuous at $x=4$?

Factor the numerator:

$$
x^2-16=(x-4)(x+4)
$$

So for $x\ne 4$,

$$
\frac{x^2-16}{x-4}=x+4
$$

The limit as $x\to 4$ is

4+4=8

To make the function continuous, set

Find the one-sided limits.

From the left:

\frac{x^2-1}{x-1}=\frac{(x-1)(x+1)}{x-1}=x+1
$$

so

$$
\lim_{x \to 1^-} g(x)=2

$$
\lim_{x \to 1^+} (2x+1)=3

Since the one-sided limits are different, the two-sided limit does not exist.

Evaluate the limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 2} \left(\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}+x\right)
$$

:::solution
Factor the fraction first:

$$
\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=x+2
$$

So the expression becomes

$$
(x+2)+x=2x+2

Now substitute $x=2$:

2(2)+2=6

So the limit is $6$.

:::solution
Rewrite the expression so the standard limit appears:

\frac{\sin(3x)}{x}=3\cdot \frac{\sin(3x)}{3x}

Then apply the standard limit:

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} 3\cdot \frac{\sin(3x)}{3x}=3\cdot 1=3

Evaluate the limit:

$$

:::solution
Since

$$
-1 \le \sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \le 1,
$$

multiplying by $x^2 \ge 0$ gives

$$
-x^2 \le x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \le x^2
$$

Both bounds go to $0$ as $x\to 0$, so by the squeeze theorem,

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} x^2\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)=0
$$

:::solution
To find the horizontal asymptote, compute the limit as $x\to\infty$.

The numerator and denominator have the same degree, so the limit is the ratio of leading coefficients:

So the horizontal asymptote is

A sensor reading is modeled by

As $x$ approaches $5$, the denominator $(x-5)^2$ approaches $0$ through positive values.

So the reading grows without bound:

The expression has the indeterminate form $\frac{0}{0}$, so L'Hopital's rule applies.

Differentiate the numerator and denominator:

Use the epsilon-delta definition to show that

Give one valid choice of $\delta$ in terms of $\varepsilon$.

Start with the expression:

To make this less than $\varepsilon$, it is enough to require

3|x-2|<\varepsilon

\delta=\frac{\varepsilon}{3}

which proves the limit.

If $f$ is continuous at $x=2$ and $f(3)=10$, find $a$ and $b$.

:::solution
First find the limit from the left:

$$
\frac{x^2-4}{x-2}=\frac{(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}=x+2
$$

So the value needed for continuity at $x=2$ is

$$
2+2=4

That gives the equation

$$
2a+b=4

The condition $f(3)=10$ gives

3a+b=10

a=6

:::solution
Use the squeeze theorem first on $x\sin(1/x)$:

So

$$
\lim_{x \to 0} x\sin(1/x)=0

Also,

Find the value of $m$ that makes $f$ continuous at $x=1$, and decide whether $f$ has a horizontal asymptote.

:::solution
Factor the numerator:

x^2-1=(x-1)(x+1)
$$

So for $x\ne 1$,

$$
f(x)=x+1
$$

The limit as $x\to 1$ is

1+1=2

So continuity at $x=1$ requires

m=2

For end behavior, the function behaves like $x+1$ as $x\to\infty$, so it grows without bound.

Therefore, $f$ does not have a horizontal asymptote.
