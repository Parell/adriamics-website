Which of the following are propositions?

1. $x > 3$
2. $7$ is prime
3. Close the door.
4. Every even integer is divisible by $2$.

:::solution
1. This is not a proposition because the truth value depends on the unspecified variable $x$.
2. This is a proposition, and it is true.
3. This is not a proposition because it is a command.
4. This is a proposition, and it is true.

Let $P$ be true and $Q$ be false. Find the truth value of

$$
(P \land \neg Q) \lor (\neg P \to Q).
$$

:::solution
Since $Q$ is false, $\neg Q$ is true, so

$$
P \land \neg Q = T \land T = T.
$$

Also, $\neg P$ is false, so

$$
\neg P \to Q = F \to F = T.
$$

Therefore,

$$
(P \land \neg Q) \lor (\neg P \to Q) = T \lor T = T.

If $P$ is false and $Q$ is false, determine the truth values of $P \to Q$ and $P \leftrightarrow Q$.

:::solution
An implication is false only when the antecedent is true and the conclusion is false. Since $P$ is false,

$$
P \to Q = T.
$$

A biconditional is true when both statements have the same truth value. Since both $P$ and $Q$ are false,

$$
P \leftrightarrow Q = T.

Write the contrapositive of the statement:

If a number is divisible by $6$, then it is divisible by $3$.

:::solution
Let $P$ be "the number is divisible by $6$" and $Q$ be "the number is divisible by $3$."

The contrapositive of $P \to Q$ is

$$
\neg Q \to \neg P.
$$

So the contrapositive is:

If a number is not divisible by $3$, then it is not divisible by $6$.

Find a logically equivalent formula for

$$
\neg(P \land (Q \lor R)).
$$

:::solution
Apply De Morgan's laws:

$$
\neg(P \land (Q \lor R)) \equiv \neg P \lor \neg(Q \lor R).
$$

Then negate the disjunction:

$$
\neg(Q \lor R) \equiv \neg Q \land \neg R.

So an equivalent formula is

\neg P \lor (\neg Q \land \neg R).

Rewrite $P \leftrightarrow Q$ using only implications.

A biconditional means both implications hold:

This matches the definition of "if and only if."

The negation of a universal statement is existential:

The negation of an existential statement is universal:

Are the statements

:::solution
No. The order of quantifiers matters.

The second statement says there is one single $y$ that works for every $x$.

These are different claims, so they are not logically equivalent.

Simplify the formula

$$
\neg(P \land Q) \land P.
$$

:::solution
First apply De Morgan's law:

$$
\neg(P \land Q) \equiv \neg P \lor \neg Q.
$$

So the formula becomes

$$
(\neg P \lor \neg Q) \land P.
$$

Distribute $P$ across the disjunction:

$$
(\neg P \land P) \lor (\neg Q \land P).
$$

Since $\neg P \land P \equiv F$, this simplifies to

$$
P \land \neg Q.
$$

skills: [Quantifiers, Implication, Negating Quantifiers]

Negate the statement

$$
\forall x\, (P(x) \to Q(x)).
$$

:::solution
First flip the universal quantifier:

$$
\neg \forall x\, (P(x) \to Q(x)) \equiv \exists x\, \neg(P(x) \to Q(x)).
$$

Then use the implication equivalence:

$$
P(x) \to Q(x) \equiv \neg P(x) \lor Q(x).
$$

So

$$
\neg(P(x) \to Q(x)) \equiv P(x) \land \neg Q(x).
$$

Therefore the negation is

$$
\exists x\, (P(x) \land \neg Q(x)).

By the definition of intersection, this means $x \in A$ and $x \in B$.

No. This is the fallacy of affirming the consequent.

Is

The formula requires both $P \to Q$ and $P$ to be true, which forces $Q$ to be true by modus ponens.

For $\forall x\, \exists y\, P(x,y)$, every $x$ can choose itself as $y$. So this statement is true.

For $\exists y\, \forall x\, P(x,y)$, we would need one single $y$ that equals both $1$ and $2$. That is impossible, so this statement is false.

Let $x$ be arbitrary. Then

That is equivalent to saying $x$ is not in both $A$ and $B$, so

x \notin A \quad \text{or} \quad x \notin B.

This is the same as

$$
x \in A^c \quad \text{or} \quad x \in B^c,

Since the two sides contain exactly the same elements, the sets are equal.

Is the set of statements

consistent?

:::solution
No, the set is inconsistent.

From $\exists x\, P(x)$, choose a witness $c$ such that $P(c)$ is true.

From $\forall x(P(x) \to Q(x))$, we get $P(c) \to Q(c)$, so $Q(c)$ is true.

But $\forall x\, \neg Q(x)$ gives $\neg Q(c)$.

So we obtain both $Q(c)$ and $\neg Q(c)$, which is impossible. Therefore the set is not consistent.
