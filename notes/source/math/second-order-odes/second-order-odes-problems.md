Classify the differential equation below. State whether it is second-order, linear, homogeneous, and constant-coefficient.

$$
y'' + 3y' - 4y = 0
$$

:::solution
The highest derivative is \(y''\), so it is a second-order ODE.

The equation is linear because \(y\), \(y'\), and \(y''\) each appear to the first power and are not multiplied together.

It is homogeneous because the right-hand side is \(0\).

It has constant coefficients because \(1\), \(3\), and \(-4\) are constants.

Rewrite the equation in normalized form \(y'' + p(x)y' + q(x)y = r(x)\).

$$
4y'' - 2y' + 7y = 5e^x
$$

:::solution
Divide every term by \(4\):

$$
y'' - \frac{1}{2}y' + \frac{7}{4}y = \frac{5}{4}e^x
$$

So the normalized form is

$$
y'' - \frac{1}{2}y' + \frac{7}{4}y = \frac{5}{4}e^x.

The function \(f\) is continuous everywhere, and its partial derivatives with respect to \(y\) and \(y'\) are also continuous everywhere.

:::solution
The homogeneous equation has characteristic equation

$$
y_h = (C_1 + C_2x)e^x.
$$

Because the forcing is \(e^x\), use a resonant trial

Substituting gives \(A=\tfrac12\), so

$$
y = (C_1 + C_2x)e^x + \frac12 x^2 e^x.

Now apply the initial conditions. From \(y(0)=0\),

For an undamped spring, the equation is

y = C_1\cos(3t) + C_2\sin(3t).

Released from rest means \(y'(0)=0\). Since
