\mathbf{x}

An equilibrium occurs when both derivatives are zero.

A system has eigenvalues

$$

What qualitative behavior should you expect?

:::solution
Complex eigenvalues produce oscillation, and the real part controls growth or decay.

Here the real part is $1$, so the oscillations are multiplied by $e^t$.

That means the motion oscillates while growing in size, so trajectories spiral outward.

Because the matrix is diagonal, each component solves its own scalar equation.

Find the equilibrium point.

:::solution
At equilibrium, set both derivatives equal to zero:

$$
-3x + y + 4 = 0,
$$

$$
2x - 2y + 1 = 0.
$$

From the second equation,

$$
x - y = -\frac{1}{2},

so

$$
y = x + \frac{1}{2}.

Substitute into the first equation:

$$
-3x + \left(x + \frac{1}{2}\right) + 4 = 0.
$$

Combine terms:

$$
-2x + \frac{9}{2} = 0.

So

x = \frac{9}{4}.

Then

$$
y = \frac{9}{4} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{11}{4}.

The matrix has repeated eigenvalue $3$ and only one eigenvector, so it is defective.

The system can be written as

y' &= x + 2y - 3

$$

Find the equilibrium point, shift variables to move the equilibrium to the origin, and classify the shifted linear system.

:::solution
First find the equilibrium by setting both derivatives equal to zero:

$$
2x - y + 1 = 0,
$$

$$
x + 2y - 3 = 0.
$$

Solving gives

$$
\left(\frac{1}{5}, \frac{7}{5}\right).
$$

Now shift variables:

$$
u = x - \frac{1}{5}, \qquad v = y - \frac{7}{5}.
$$

Because the constant terms disappear after shifting, the new system is

$$
\begin{aligned}
u' &= 2u - v \\
v' &= u + 2v.

$$

The coefficient matrix is

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & -1 \\

The real part is positive, so the equilibrium is an **unstable spiral**.

$$

Find the equilibria and use linearization to determine which ones you can classify directly.

:::solution
Set both derivatives equal to zero:

$$
x(1-y)=0, \qquad y(x-2)=0.
$$

This gives the equilibria

$$
(0,0), \quad (2,0), \quad (2,1).

Now compute the Jacobian:

$$
J(x,y) =

At $(0,0)$,

$$
J(0,0) =
\begin{bmatrix}

The eigenvalues are $1$ and $-2$, so $(0,0)$ is a saddle and is unstable.

At $(2,0)$,

$$
J(2,0) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & -2 \\
0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

One eigenvalue is $0$, so linearization is inconclusive there.

At $(2,1)$,

$$
J(2,1) =
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & -2 \\
1 & 0

$$

whose eigenvalues are purely imaginary, so linearization is also inconclusive there.

Only $(0,0)$ can be classified directly from the linearization.

Since
