# What a vector is

A **vector** is an object with both magnitude and direction. In geometry and physics, vectors represent quantities such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force.

This note is the single source for vector notation and operations, including
dot products, cross products, projections, and vector equations of lines and
planes. The short prerequisite review below supplies the geometric language
needed to read those topics; for a fuller treatment of elementary geometry,
see the [Geometry note](../geometry/geometry.md).

## Recalled from geometry

Geometry supplies the basic spatial language used here:

- points and coordinates such as $(x,y)$ and $(x,y,z)$
- directed segments, lines, planes, parallelism, and perpendicularity
- the scalar slope, distance, and midpoint formulas in the plane
- the Pythagorean theorem and basic right-triangle measurement

These are prerequisites, not a second treatment. Their vector forms and
higher-dimensional extensions are developed below. For the geometric review,
see the [Geometry note](../geometry/geometry.md).

In algebra, vectors are often treated as ordered lists of numbers in $\mathbb{R}^n$:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \langle v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \rangle
$$

The numbers $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n$ are the **components** of the vector.

## Geometric view

In 2D or 3D, a vector can be drawn as an arrow:

- Length represents magnitude
- Arrow direction represents orientation
- The vector is independent of its position in space

Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction, even if they start at different points.

## Free vectors and position vectors

- A **free vector** can be translated anywhere without changing it.
- A **position vector** starts at the origin and ends at a point.

If $P = (x, y, z)$, then the position vector of $P$ is

$$
\mathbf{p} = \langle x, y, z \rangle
$$

# Notation and components

Vectors may be written in several equivalent forms:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \langle 3, -2 \rangle
$$

$$
\mathbf{v} =
\begin{bmatrix}
3 \\
-2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\mathbf{v} = 3\mathbf{i} - 2\mathbf{j}
$$

In 3D:

$$
\mathbf{v} = a\mathbf{i} + b\mathbf{j} + c\mathbf{k}
$$

where $\mathbf{i}$, $\mathbf{j}$, and $\mathbf{k}$ are the standard basis vectors:

$$
\mathbf{i} = \langle 1, 0, 0 \rangle,\quad
\mathbf{j} = \langle 0, 1, 0 \rangle,\quad
\mathbf{k} = \langle 0, 0, 1 \rangle
$$

## Component form from two points

If a vector goes from point $A(x_1, y_1)$ to point $B(x_2, y_2)$, then

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} = \langle x_2 - x_1,\ y_2 - y_1 \rangle
$$

In 3D:

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} = \langle x_2 - x_1,\ y_2 - y_1,\ z_2 - z_1 \rangle
$$

This is one of the most common ways vectors appear in geometry problems.

# Magnitude and unit vectors

The **magnitude** or length of $\mathbf{v} = \langle v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n \rangle$ is

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2}
$$

In 2D:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
$$

In 3D:

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}
$$

## Unit vectors

A **unit vector** has length 1. The unit vector in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$ is

$$
\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

provided $\mathbf{v} \neq \mathbf{0}$.

Example:

If $\mathbf{v} = \langle 3, 4 \rangle$, then

$$
\|\mathbf{v}\| = 5,\qquad
\hat{\mathbf{v}} = \left\langle \frac{3}{5}, \frac{4}{5} \right\rangle
$$

## Direction in 2D

If $\mathbf{v} = \langle x, y \rangle$, then the direction angle $\theta$ satisfies

$$
\tan \theta = \frac{y}{x}
$$

with the correct quadrant chosen from the signs of $x$ and $y$.

# Basic vector operations

## Addition and subtraction

For $\mathbf{u} = \langle u_1, u_2, \dots \rangle$ and $\mathbf{v} = \langle v_1, v_2, \dots \rangle$:

$$
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \langle u_1 + v_1,\ u_2 + v_2,\ \dots \rangle
$$

$$
\mathbf{u} - \mathbf{v} = \langle u_1 - v_1,\ u_2 - v_2,\ \dots \rangle
$$

Geometrically, addition follows the **tip-to-tail** or **parallelogram** rule.

## Scalar multiplication

For scalar $c$:

$$
c\mathbf{v} = \langle cv_1, cv_2, \dots, cv_n \rangle
$$

Effects:

- If $|c| > 1$, the vector stretches
- If $0 < |c| < 1$, the vector shrinks
- If $c < 0$, the direction reverses

## Zero vector

The zero vector is

$$
\mathbf{0} = \langle 0, 0, \dots, 0 \rangle
$$

It has zero magnitude and no direction.

Geometrically, the zero vector represents **no displacement**: the starting
point and ending point are the same. It is not an arrow pointing in a special
direction; its length is zero, so there is no orientation to measure. For
example, if a particle moves from $A$ to $B$ and then returns to $A$, its net
displacement is $\mathbf{0}$.

The zero vector is the additive identity because adding it changes nothing:

$$
\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{0} = \mathbf{v}
$$

It is also the result when a vector is subtracted from itself:

$$
\mathbf{v} - \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}
$$

Two details are especially important:

- The zero vector is perpendicular to every vector in the algebraic sense that
  $\mathbf{0} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$, but the usual angle formula does not give
  it an angle because it requires division by $\lVert\mathbf{0}\rVert$.
- It cannot be normalized. The expression
  $\mathbf{0}/\lVert\mathbf{0}\rVert$ divides by zero, so the zero vector has
  no associated unit vector.

# Dot product

The **dot product** of two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \cdots + u_nv_n
$$

In 2D:

$$
\langle a, b \rangle \cdot \langle c, d \rangle = ac + bd
$$

In 3D:

$$
\langle a, b, c \rangle \cdot \langle d, e, f \rangle = ad + be + cf
$$

## Angle between vectors

The dot product also satisfies

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\| \cos \theta
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle between the vectors.

So

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

This is often the fastest way to find an angle.

## Orthogonality

Two nonzero vectors are **orthogonal** if their dot product is zero:

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0
$$

This means the vectors are perpendicular.

## Projection idea from the dot product

The scalar component of $\mathbf{v}$ along $\mathbf{u}$ is

$$
\operatorname{comp}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v}
= \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|}
$$

The vector projection is covered in the next section.

# Cross product

The **cross product** is defined for vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

For

$$
\mathbf{u} = \langle u_1, u_2, u_3 \rangle,\qquad
\mathbf{v} = \langle v_1, v_2, v_3 \rangle
$$

the cross product is

$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}
=
\begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}
$$

which expands to

$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}
= \langle u_2v_3 - u_3v_2,\ u_3v_1 - u_1v_3,\ u_1v_2 - u_2v_1 \rangle
$$

## Geometric meaning

- $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}$ is perpendicular to both $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$
- Its magnitude is

$$
\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\| = \|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\| \sin \theta
$$

- It gives the area of the parallelogram spanned by the two vectors

So the triangle area is

$$
\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|
$$

## Orientation

The cross product is not commutative:

$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u})
$$

Use the right-hand rule to determine direction.

# Vector projections

The projection of $\mathbf{v}$ onto $\mathbf{u}$ is the component of $\mathbf{v}$ that points along $\mathbf{u}$.

## Scalar projection

$$
\operatorname{comp}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v}
= \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|}
$$

## Vector projection

$$
\operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v}
= \frac{\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}}{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{u}} \mathbf{u}
$$

This formula is useful in decomposition problems and least-squares geometry.

## Orthogonal decomposition

Any vector can be split into parallel and perpendicular parts relative to $\mathbf{u}$:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v}_\perp
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{v}_\perp = \mathbf{v} - \operatorname{proj}_{\mathbf{u}} \mathbf{v}
$$

and $\mathbf{v}_\perp \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$.

# Lines and planes

Vectors provide compact equations for geometric objects.

## Line in 2D or 3D

A line through point $\mathbf{r}_0$ with direction vector $\mathbf{d}$ has vector equation

$$
\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{r}_0 + t\mathbf{d}
$$

where $t$ is a parameter.

In components:

$$
x = x_0 + at,\qquad y = y_0 + bt,\qquad z = z_0 + ct
$$

if $\mathbf{d} = \langle a, b, c \rangle$.

## Plane in 3D

A plane through point $\mathbf{r}_0$ with normal vector $\mathbf{n}$ satisfies

$$
\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) = 0
$$

If $\mathbf{n} = \langle A, B, C \rangle$ and $\mathbf{r}_0 = (x_0, y_0, z_0)$, then

$$
A(x - x_0) + B(y - y_0) + C(z - z_0) = 0
$$

This is the standard point-normal form of a plane.

## Distance from a point to a plane

For plane

$$
Ax + By + Cz + D = 0
$$

and point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$, the distance is

$$
\frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + Cz_0 + D|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2 + C^2}}
$$

# Common workflows

## Find the vector from one point to another

1. Identify the initial point $A$ and terminal point $B$
2. Subtract coordinates: $B - A$
3. Simplify the components

Example:

If $A = (1, -3)$ and $B = (5, 2)$, then

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} = \langle 4, 5 \rangle
$$

## Find an angle between vectors

1. Compute $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}$
2. Compute $\|\mathbf{u}\|$ and $\|\mathbf{v}\|$
3. Use

$$
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \, \|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

4. Apply inverse cosine

## Test perpendicularity or parallelism

- Perpendicular: $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = 0$
- Parallel: one vector is a scalar multiple of the other

## Build a line or plane

- Line: point plus direction vector
- Plane: point plus normal vector

If the problem gives a geometric picture, convert it to vectors first. The algebra is usually simpler afterward.

# Pitfalls

## Sign mistakes in components

When subtracting coordinates, always use

$$
\overrightarrow{AB} = B - A
$$

not the other way around unless the direction is intentionally reversed.

## Confusing dot product with multiplication

The dot product produces a scalar, not a vector.

## Confusing dot and cross products

- Dot product measures alignment and angle
- Cross product measures perpendicularity and area in 3D

## Forgetting absolute value in distance formulas

Distance is always nonnegative. Use absolute value when needed.

## Using the wrong dimension

- Dot product works in any dimension
- Cross product, in the standard form, is a 3D operation

## Losing the direction of a vector

A vector is not just its length. Reversing a vector changes its direction even if the magnitude stays the same.

## Final checks

Before moving on in a vector problem, verify:

- The components point the correct way
- The dimensions match the operation
- Units are consistent if the vectors are physical quantities
- The final answer has the right geometric meaning
