If

$$

what are $v(2)$ and $a(2)$?

:::solution
Differentiate once to get velocity:

$$
v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 4t - 3
$$

So

$$
v(2) = 4(2) - 3 = 5

Differentiate again to get acceleration:

a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = 4

For a constant force,

A ball is launched from level ground at $20\ \text{m/s}$ at an angle of $60^\circ$ above the horizontal. Take $g = 10\ \text{m/s}^2$. How far horizontally has it traveled when it reaches its highest point?

:::solution
At the top of the flight, the vertical velocity is zero.

The initial vertical component is

$$
v_{0y} = 20\sin 60^\circ = 10\sqrt{3}
$$

That gives the time to the top:

$$
t = \frac{v_{0y}}{g} = \frac{10\sqrt{3}}{10} = \sqrt{3}\ \text{s}
$$

The horizontal speed is constant:

$$
v_{0x} = 20\cos 60^\circ = 10

So the horizontal distance is

$$
x = v_{0x}t = 10\sqrt{3}\ \text{m}

By the work-energy theorem,

$$

A $0.5$ kg puck moves at $6\ \text{m/s}$ to the right. A force of $10\ \text{N}$ acts to the left for $0.2\ \text{s}$. What is the puck's final speed?

:::solution
The impulse is

$$
J = F\Delta t = 10(0.2) = 2\ \text{N}\cdot\text{s}
$$

Because the force is to the left, the impulse is negative relative to the original motion.

Initial momentum:

$$
p_i = mv = 0.5(6) = 3
$$

Final momentum:

$$
p_f = p_i - 2 = 1\ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m/s}

:::solution
The no-slip condition gives

$$
v_{cm} = R\omega
$$

so

$$
\omega = \frac{5}{0.3} = \frac{50}{3}\ \text{rad/s}
$$

The translational kinetic energy is

$$
T_{trans} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}(4)(25) = 50\ \text{J}
$$

The moment of inertia is

$$
I = \frac{1}{2}(4)(0.3^2) = 0.18\ \text{kg}\cdot\text{m}^2
$$

The rotational kinetic energy is

$$
T_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2
       = \frac{1}{2}(0.18)\left(\frac{50}{3}\right)^2

Let the left reaction be $R_L$ and the right reaction be $R_R$.

Compute the derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}} = m\dot{x}

Also,

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = -kx

First find the moment of inertia of the disk:

A mass moves on a frictionless line between two identical springs, each with spring constant $k$. If the mass is displaced by $x$ from equilibrium, derive the equation of motion using the Lagrangian method.

:::solution
Each spring contributes a potential energy of $\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, so the total potential energy is

$$
V = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = kx^2
$$

The kinetic energy is

$$
T = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2

So the Lagrangian is

\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^2 - kx^2

Apply the Euler-Lagrange equation:

$$
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}}\right) - \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 0
$$

Compute the derivatives:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}} = m\dot{x}

\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot{x}}\right) = m\ddot{x}

\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = -2kx

Thus the equation of motion is
