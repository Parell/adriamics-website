---

Two point charges, $q_1 = +3\,\mu\text{C}$ and $q_2 = -2\,\mu\text{C}$, are separated by $0.50\ \text{m}$.

Find the magnitude of the force between them and state whether the force is attractive or repulsive.

:::solution
Use Coulomb's law:

$$
F = k\frac{|q_1q_2|}{r^2}
$$

Substitute the values:

$$
F = 9.0\times 10^9 \frac{(3\times 10^{-6})(2\times 10^{-6})}{(0.50)^2}
$$

$$
F = 0.216\ \text{N}
$$

Because the charges have opposite signs, the force is attractive.

A charge of $+5.0\ \text{nC}$ is located in space.

What is the magnitude of the electric field $0.20\ \text{m}$ away from the charge, and what is its direction?

A uniform charge of $12\ \mu\text{C}$ is spread along a thin wire of length $3.0\ \text{m}$.

Linear charge density is

For a uniform wire, this becomes

Electric potential adds as a scalar:

Compute each contribution:

$$
V_1 = 9.0\times 10^9 \frac{4.0\times 10^{-9}}{0.30} = 120\ \text{V}

$$
V_2 = 9.0\times 10^9 \frac{-1.0\times 10^{-9}}{0.20} = -45\ \text{V}

With a dielectric,

A wire has resistivity $2.0\times 10^{-6}\ \Omega\cdot\text{m}$, length $4.0\ \text{m}$, and cross-sectional area $2.0\times 10^{-6}\ \text{m}^2$.

Find its resistance, and then find the current if a $12\ \text{V}$ potential difference is applied across it.

For a uniform conductor,

$$
R = \rho\frac{L}{A}

Substitute:

$$
R = (2.0\times 10^{-6})\frac{4.0}{2.0\times 10^{-6}} = 4.0\ \Omega

Now use Ohm's law:

Two charges lie on a line: a $+6.0\ \text{nC}$ charge on the left and a $-6.0\ \text{nC}$ charge on the right. A point is exactly halfway between them, $0.10\ \text{m}$ from each charge.

What is the net electric field at the midpoint?

:::solution
Each charge produces a field of magnitude

$$
E = k\frac{|q|}{r^2}
$$

So for one charge,

$$
E_1 = 9.0\times 10^9 \frac{6.0\times 10^{-9}}{(0.10)^2} = 5400\ \text{N/C}
$$

At the midpoint, the field from the positive charge points to the right, and the field from the negative charge also points to the right.

So the fields add:

$$
E_{\text{net}} = 2(5400) = 1.08\times 10^4\ \text{N/C}

The direction is to the right, from the positive charge toward the negative charge.

Two capacitors of $3.0\ \mu\text{F}$ and $6.0\ \mu\text{F}$ are connected in series across a $12\ \text{V}$ battery.

Find the equivalent capacitance and the charge on each capacitor.

:::solution
For capacitors in series,

So

$$
C_{\text{eq}} = 2.0\ \mu\text{F}

The charge stored by the series combination is

$$
Q = C_{\text{eq}}V = (2.0\ \mu\text{F})(12\ \text{V}) = 24\ \mu\text{C}

In series, each capacitor has the same charge, so each one stores $24\ \mu\text{C}$.

What is the sign of the induced emf, and what is the actual current direction?

With counterclockwise chosen as positive, the associated area vector points out of the page.

The magnetic flux is therefore positive, and because the field is increasing, $d\Phi_B/dt > 0$.

Faraday's law gives

$$

So the induced emf is negative.

A negative emf means the actual current goes opposite the positive loop direction, so the current is clockwise.
