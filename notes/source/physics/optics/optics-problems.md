A student is studying the bright and dark bands produced by light passing through two slits.

A ray of light goes from air into water.

Substitute the values:

Subtract:

An object is placed

d_o = 10\ \text{cm}

Find the image distance, and state whether the image is real or virtual.

:::solution
Use the thin lens equation:

$$
\frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{d_i}.
$$

So

$$
\frac{1}{d_i} = \frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{10} = -\frac{1}{30}.
$$

Thus

$$
d_i = -30\ \text{cm}.

The negative sign means the image is **virtual** and on the same side as the object.

The magnification is

$$

So the image is upright and enlarged.

Light travels from air into water. The angle of incidence in air is

30^\circ

and the refractive index of water is

$$
n = 1.33.
$$

Find the refracted angle in water and the speed of light in water.

:::solution
Use Snell's law with $n_1 \approx 1$ for air:

n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2.
$$

So

$$
\sin \theta_2 = \frac{1}{1.33}\sin 30^\circ

A converging lens with focal length

forms an image from an object placed

$$
d_{o1} = 30\ \text{cm}
$$

in front of it.

A second converging lens with focal length

$$
f_2 = 15\ \text{cm}
$$

is placed 20 cm to the right of the first lens.

Find the final image position relative to the second lens and describe the final image.

:::solution
First lens:

$$
\frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{30} + \frac{1}{d_{i1}}
$$

so

$$
\frac{1}{d_{i1}} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{30} = \frac{1}{15},
$$

and

$$
d_{i1} = 15\ \text{cm}.
$$

That image is 15 cm to the right of the first lens, so it is 5 cm to the left of the second lens. Thus the second lens has object distance

$$
d_{o2} = 5\ \text{cm}.
$$

Second lens:

$$
\frac{1}{15} = \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{d_{i2}}.
$$

So

$$
\frac{1}{d_{i2}} = \frac{1}{15} - \frac{1}{5} = -\frac{2}{15},
$$

and

$$
d_{i2} = -7.5\ \text{cm}.
$$

The negative sign means the final image is virtual and on the left side of the second lens.

The magnifications are

$$
m_1 = -\frac{15}{30} = -\frac{1}{2},
\qquad
m_2 = -\frac{-7.5}{5} = \frac{3}{2}.

So the total magnification is

$$
m = m_1 m_2 = -\frac{3}{4}.

The final image is virtual, inverted relative to the original object, and slightly smaller.

Is the reflected light bright or dark?

The path difference of $\lambda/2$ contributes a phase shift of $\pi$.

The reflection from lower index to higher index adds another phase shift of $\pi$.

The total phase difference is therefore

\pi + \pi = 2\pi,

For second order, $m=2$:

2.0 \times 10^{-6} \sin \theta = 2(500 \times 10^{-9}).

The Rayleigh criterion says

For the same wavelength, $\theta_{\min}$ is inversely proportional to aperture diameter.

The incident angle is 65 degrees, which is larger than the critical angle.

$$
f_2 = -28\ \text{cm}
$$

is placed 50 cm to the right of the first lens.

Find the final image position relative to the second lens, and state whether the final image is upright or inverted.

:::solution
For the first lens:

$$
\frac{1}{12} = \frac{1}{18} + \frac{1}{d_{i1}}.
$$

So

$$
\frac{1}{d_{i1}} = \frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{18} = \frac{1}{36},
$$

and

$$
d_{i1} = 36\ \text{cm}.
$$

That image is 36 cm to the right of the first lens, so it is 14 cm to the left of the second lens. Thus the second lens has object distance

$$
d_{o2} = 14\ \text{cm}.
$$

For the second lens:

$$
\frac{1}{-28} = \frac{1}{14} + \frac{1}{d_{i2}}.
$$

So

$$
\frac{1}{d_{i2}} = -\frac{1}{28} - \frac{1}{14} = -\frac{3}{28},
$$

which gives

$$
d_{i2} = -\frac{28}{3}\ \text{cm}.
$$

The negative sign means the final image is virtual and on the left side of the second lens.

The magnifications are

$$
m_1 = -\frac{36}{18} = -2,
\qquad
m_2 = -\frac{-28/3}{14} = \frac{2}{3}.

After the middle polarizer,

$$
I = \frac{I_0}{2}\cos^2 \theta.

The third polarizer is crossed with the first, so it makes an angle of $90^\circ - \theta$ with the middle one. The final intensity is

I = \frac{I_0}{2}\cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta.

Use

$$
I = \frac{I_0}{8}\sin^2(2\theta).

Set this equal to $I_0/16$:

$$
\frac{I_0}{8}\sin^2(2\theta) = \frac{I_0}{16}.

\sin^2(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2}.
