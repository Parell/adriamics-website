A $3.0\,\mu\text{C}$ charge is placed in a uniform electric field of $250\ \text{N/C}$. What is the force magnitude?

:::solution
Use

:::solution
The change in field is

\Delta B = 0.60 - 0.10 = 0.50\ \text{T}
$$

The flux change per turn is

$$
\Delta \Phi_B = A\Delta B = (0.020)(0.50) = 0.010\ \text{Wb}

:::solution
The area of the loop is

$$
A = (0.20)^2 = 0.040\ \text{m}^2
$$

The change in field is

$$
\Delta B = 0.30 - 0.10 = 0.20\ \text{T}

So the flux change is

$$
\Delta \Phi_B = A\Delta B = (0.040)(0.20) = 0.008\ \text{Wb}

The induced emf magnitude is

$$
\mathcal{E} = \frac{\Delta \Phi_B}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.008}{0.50} = 0.016\ \text{V}

Thus the induced current is

The time constant is

The final charge is

For the current,

X_L = \omega L \approx (314)(0.20) = 62.8\ \Omega

X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{(314)(100 \times 10^{-6})} \approx 31.8\ \Omega
