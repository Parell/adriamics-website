In one frame, two events are simultaneous and separated by $12\ \text{m}$ along the $x$-axis. If $S'$ moves in the $+x$ direction at $0.6c$, what is $\Delta t'$?

:::solution
If the events are simultaneous in the first frame, then $\Delta t = 0$ and

$$
\Delta t' = -\gamma \frac{v\Delta x}{c^2}.

With $\gamma = 1.25$, $v = 0.6c$, and $\Delta x = 12\ \text{m}$:

$$
\Delta t' = -1.25\cdot \frac{0.6c\cdot 12}{c^2}

Since $c = 3.00\times 10^8\ \text{m/s}$,

In frame $S$, an event occurs at $t = 2.0\times 10^{-8}\ \text{s}$ and $x = 3.0\ \text{m}$. If $S'$ moves at $v = 0.6c$ in the $+x$ direction, find $x'$ and $t'$.

:::solution
For $v = 0.6c$, we have $\gamma = 1.25$.

Use the Lorentz transformations:

$$
x' = \gamma(x-vt)
$$

and

$$
t' = \gamma\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^2}\right).
$$

First compute $vt$:

$$
vt = (0.6c)(2.0\times 10^{-8}\ \text{s}) = 3.6\ \text{m}.
$$

So

$$
x' = 1.25(3.0-3.6) = 1.25(-0.6) = -0.75\ \text{m}.
$$

Next,

$$
\frac{vx}{c^2} = \frac{0.6c\cdot 3.0}{c^2} = \frac{1.8}{c} = 6.0\times 10^{-9}\ \text{s}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
t' = 1.25(2.0\times 10^{-8} - 6.0\times 10^{-9})
= 1.25(1.4\times 10^{-8})
= 1.75\times 10^{-8}\ \text{s}.

A spaceship moves at $0.8c$ for $10\ \mu\text{s}$ as measured in Earth frame. How much proper time passes on the ship, and how far does it travel in Earth frame?

:::solution
For $v = 0.8c$,

$$
\gamma = \frac{5}{3}.

The proper time is

$$
\Delta \tau = \frac{\Delta t}{\gamma} = \frac{10\ \mu\text{s}}{5/3} = 6\ \mu\text{s}.
$$

The Earth-frame distance is

$$
d = vt = (0.8c)(10\times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}) = 2.4\times 10^3\ \text{m}.

So the ship experiences $6\ \mu\text{s}$, and it travels $2400\ \text{m}$ in Earth frame.

Factor out $m^2c^4$:

:::solution
For $v = 0.8c$, we have

So the lab-frame lifetime is

\Delta t = \gamma \Delta \tau = \frac{5}{3}(2.2\ \mu\text{s}) \approx 3.67\ \mu\text{s}.

The distance traveled is

$$
d = vt \approx (0.8c)(3.67\times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}) \approx 8.8\times 10^2\ \text{m}.

Since $880\ \text{m} > 500\ \text{m}$, the particle reaches the detector before decaying.

Two lightning flashes happen simultaneously in Earth's frame and are separated by $20\ \text{m}$ along the $x$-axis. If a train moves at $0.6c$ in the $+x$ direction, what time separation does the train measure?

Use the simultaneity formula with $\Delta t = 0$:

\Delta t' = -\gamma \frac{v\Delta x}{c^2}.

For $v = 0.6c$, $\gamma = 1.25$. Then

$$
\Delta t' = -1.25\cdot \frac{0.6c\cdot 20}{c^2}

Since $c = 3.00\times 10^8\ \text{m/s}$,

A muon has proper lifetime $2.2\ \mu\text{s}$ and moves at $0.6c$. It is created in the upper atmosphere $500\ \text{m}$ above the ground. Does it reach the ground before decaying?

The distance traveled is

d = vt = (0.6c)(2.75\times 10^{-6}\ \text{s}) \approx 4.95\times 10^2\ \text{m}.

The time coordinate transforms as

If the two strikes occur at different positions, the $vx/c^2$ term is different for each event. That means equal $t$ in Earth frame does not imply equal $t'$ in the train frame.

Because the particles have equal and opposite momenta, the total momentum is zero. After they stick together, the composite object is at rest, so its rest energy is

In frame $S$, two events are simultaneous and separated by $24\ \text{m}$. Another frame $S'$ measures them to be $80\ \text{ns}$ apart in time. What is the speed of $S'$ relative to $S$? Give the magnitude.

:::solution
With $\Delta t = 0$,

$$
\Delta t' = -\gamma \frac{v\Delta x}{c^2}.
$$

Take magnitudes:

$$
|\Delta t'| = \gamma \frac{v\Delta x}{c^2}.
$$

Substitute $|\Delta t'| = 80\ \text{ns}$ and $\Delta x = 24\ \text{m}$:

$$
c|\Delta t'| = (3.00\times 10^8)(80\times 10^{-9}) = 24\ \text{m}.
$$

So

$$
24 = \gamma v \frac{24}{c},
$$

which simplifies to

$$
\gamma \beta = 1,
$$

where $\beta = v/c$.

Thus

$$
\frac{\beta}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} = 1.
$$

Square both sides:

$$
\beta^2 = 1-\beta^2
$$

so

$$
2\beta^2 = 1

\beta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.

Therefore,

v = \frac{c}{\sqrt{2}} \approx 0.707c.

Two events occur $10\ \text{ns}$ apart and $1.8\ \text{m}$ apart. Find the invariant interval and the proper time between them, if it exists.

:::solution
First compute the light-travel distance:

c\Delta t = (3.00\times 10^8)(10\times 10^{-9}) = 3\ \text{m}.

Since $3\ \text{m} > 1.8\ \text{m}$, the interval is timelike.

The invariant interval is

$$
\Delta s^2 = c^2\Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2 = 3^2 - 1.8^2 = 9 - 3.24 = 5.76\ \text{m}^2.
$$

For a timelike interval,

$$
\Delta \tau = \frac{\sqrt{\Delta s^2}}{c} = \frac{2.4\ \text{m}}{3.00\times 10^8\ \text{m/s}} = 8\times 10^{-9}\ \text{s}.
