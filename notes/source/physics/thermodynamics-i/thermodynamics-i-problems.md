A gas expands at constant pressure from $0.50\ \text{m}^3$ to $0.80\ \text{m}^3$ while the pressure remains $150\ \text{kPa}$.

What is the boundary work?

:::solution
For constant pressure,

A piston-cylinder device compresses a linear spring from $x_1 = 0$ to $x_2 = 0.20\ \text{m}$. The spring constant is $k = 8.0\ \text{kN/m}$.

Six hundred kilojoules of heat flows directly from a $600\ \text{K}$ reservoir to a $300\ \text{K}$ reservoir.

What is the entropy change of the universe, and does this process satisfy the Second Law?

The hot reservoir loses entropy:

The cold reservoir gains entropy:

\Delta S_{universe} = -1 + 2 = 1\ \text{kJ/K}
